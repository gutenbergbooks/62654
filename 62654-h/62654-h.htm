</h2>
</div>
<p>The Greycliff girls who had decided to go to the girls’ camp in Maine
with Patricia West, their English teacher, were busy getting ready their
camp equipment in the short time which elapsed between the close of
school and their departure for camp. School had closed early in June and
Merrymeeting Camp did not open until July 5th, but Miss West, who had
been a councillor at camp for several seasons, was to have charge of a
delightful and instructive trip that was offered by the camp authorities
to any of the older girls who wanted to take it. This would give them
the opportunity to see Niagara, Toronto, Lake Ontario, the St. Lawrence
and Thousand Islands, Montreal, and the White Mountains. The trip was so
planned that the girls would see the best part of the scenery by day,
and would have rest at hotels from the necessary sleeping car and boat
travel. All reservations were made on boat and train and at hotels, and
in the case of the girls leaving with the Cincinnati parties, even
baggage was called for at the homes and the tickets purchased.</p>
<p>Letters went back and forth. Hilary Lancaster was now living in
Cincinnati, which was also Miss West’s home. Helen Paget and Evelyn
Calvert, two Southern girls who had been at Greycliff, were to join
Hilary, visiting her a day or two and starting with her party. Cathalina
Van Buskirk and Lilian North were to join them at Buffalo; Betty Barnes,
at Toronto, where she was visiting her aunt.</p>
<p>“The whole ‘quartet’ of our suite will be together on this trip,” wrote
Lilian to Hilary, “and more of our special friends at camp,—won’t it be
jolly? I’ve never seen Niagara, nor ever been out of the United States.
I wrote to Eloise and urged her to come, but she says that she can not
possibly get ready so soon and will have to meet us at camp if she gets
there at all!”</p>
<p>It was the last Thursday in June, and the train to Buffalo was to leave
at 6:05 P.M. Cincinnati was steaming with heat during one of those days
which the beautiful Queen City can serve to its inhabitants in summer.
Perspiration shone on faces and trickled down backs. The Central Union
Station was like an oven, but cheerful, happy faces and lively
conversation, anticipatory of interesting experiences, brightened the
farewells.</p>
<p>Both Dr. and Mrs. Lancaster, with Mary, Gordon and Tommy, were there to
see Hilary and June off; for June, to her great delight, was going too.
Dr. Lancaster had packed the whole family, with their guests, Helen and
Evelyn, into his car, recently presented to him by his congregation, and
brought them from the parsonage to the station. Already Miss West was
there, with three first-year high-school girls, Jean Marshall, Marjorie
White and Rhoda Jenkins, known later at camp as “Jenkie” or “Jenks”.</p>
<p>“Think of the cool breezes in Maine,” said Dr. Lancaster, as he
delivered several small suit-cases to their owners and took out a big
white handkerchief, “to catch his tears”, as Tommy said.</p>
<p>“Tommy and I are going to our aunt’s for a visit,” said Gordon to Miss
West, for he wanted it to be known that he was not entirely left out of
good times. “And Father says that p’raps we can go to Boothbay Camp next
summer. The oldest got to go first in our family!”</p>
<p>Time sped on as they chatted, till presently the iron gates opened and
with Miss West and the tickets in the lead, the girls passed through. A
few friends were permitted to accompany them and escort them to the
train.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget your pocket-book, Jean,” admonished one auntie, through
the open window.</p>
<p>“Yes, do hang on to that, or let Miss West carry your money,” added
another.</p>
<p>“I’ve been known to leave my pocket-book,” explained Jean aside to
Hilary. “Please take this twenty-five, Miss West.”</p>
<p>“Be sure to write a card in Buffalo, Hilary,” said Dr. Lancaster.</p>
<p>“O, yes, Father, we’ll write a post-card from every single place,”
replied June, happily excited over the trip, “alone, with only Hilary!”</p>
<p>It was some time before the train started, and how they longed to get
away from the hot station! The electric fans started and gave some
relief. Bags or suit-cases were arranged, hats and umbrellas disposed
of, while Miss West counted noses and saw that each girl was in her own
section or knew where it was.</p>
<p>“Let me see. Hilary, you and June are in number nine, right over Helen
and Evelyn. Too bad you have to double in an upper. Won’t you take my
berth?”</p>
<p>“No, indeed; thank you, Miss West. It was our fault that we did not
decide about June’s going till the last minute. I’m thankful that we
could get the other reservations.”</p>
<p>“We are nicely fixed, close together and in the center of the car. Don’t
forget your numbers.”</p>
<p>One of the girls had never slept in a Pullman before and longed to ask
many questions; but ashamed to appear ignorant before the others, she
foolishly would have waited to find out herself as best she could, had
not June, who was not in the least ashamed of not having traveled at
night, asked Hilary the very questions which gave the necessary
information.</p>
<p>At last the train started. The electric lights, which had added so much
to the heat, were turned off. “O, goody, we’re moving!” exclaimed June,
settling comfortably back by Hilary, who had put June next to the window
and was fanning them both. “Goodbye, dear old Cincy, we’re going to see
lots of rivers and lakes and boats and things before we get back to the
Ohio and the Island Queen or the Morning Star.”</p>
<p>Candy boxes came out immediately and were passed around, but to Miss
West’s surprise and relief, the girls tasted sparingly.</p>
<p>“No, thanks,” said Marjorie, as Jean offered her a box of chocolates, “I
promised Mother not to touch candy till the trip was at least almost
over. She wanted me to get there all right. And any way this is my
summer to reduce. I have to take a dip every morning, get to breakfast
on time, go on the hikes and everything. And here old Jean eats twice as
much as I do, and see how nice and slim she is.”</p>
<p>“It’s in our family to be skinny,” remarked Jean. “I like what you say
about my eating twice as much as you do,” she continued, grinning at
Marjorie. “No, thank you; I had two caramels and a bonbon. See? I
brought along an <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> to show how high-brow I am. Auntie
bought it for me, though.”</p>
<p>Different magazines were produced and the girls settled down quietly to
read, chat, or watch the passing scenery. As night drew on, cooler air
came in the screened windows. The girls, tired with the heat and the
activities incident to their departure, were glad to get to their berths
as soon as the porter made them up.</p>
<p>“How do we ever get up there, Hilary?” asked June.</p>
<p>“O, the porter will bring a little ladder and will help us up; and in
the morning we’ll press a little button to ring for him and he’ll help
us down again.”</p>
<p>The tips of brown or black oxfords peeped from beneath the green
curtains behind which quiet, well-behaved girls were quickly preparing
for the night. “Here’s the hanger for our coats, Helen,” whispered
Evelyn. “Maybe we can get our dresses on it too.”</p>
<p>“Let’s use that for our dresses, they’re longer. I’ll get a hanger out
of my suit-case for the coats, or we can fold them and put them on the
shelf. See these hooks? You just pull them out straight. We certainly
shall never need that blanket!”</p>
<p>“No telling, when we get up near the lake. Why do they always have the
pillow on the end toward the engine?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I’m going to double mine up so I won’t break my neck if
the train bumps when it starts or stops.”</p>
<p>“Mother said if we wanted to sleep on our valuables not to tuck them
under our pillows where any thief could get them by slipping in a hand,
but to put them inside a pillow case and turn the open end of that
toward the inside.”</p>
<p>“I’d go off and leave them in the morning! The only safety for me is to
have them pinned to me, I guess.”</p>
<p>“All right, girls?”—in Miss West’s quiet voice, as she paused by the
various curtains. Soft replies assured her that everybody was
comfortable and soon quiet reigned in the car, except when the porter
passed through with some late arrival from one of the towns at which the
train stopped.</p>
<p>“I can’t go to sleep, Hilary,” whispered June about midnight.</p>
<p>“Are you comfy?”</p>
<p>“O, yes!”</p>
<p>“Well, don’t worry; nobody will sleep much, I suspect, this first night.
We’ll be at a hotel tomorrow night. Maybe we can rest and doze a little.
It’s getting cooler, isn’t it? Let’s draw up the blanket.”</p>
<p>Assured that it could not hurt anybody if she did not sleep, June
promptly dozed off. Such is the power of suggestion.</p>
<p>Breakfast over at Buffalo, the girls were writing cards home while
waiting for the train to Niagara. While they were thus engaged in a
corner of the waiting room where they had deposited their baggage and
one or two parcels which had already been added to the impedimenta, a
bright face peeped around the corner. “O, here they are, Cathalina!” and
with this Lilian North, smiling and happy, made her appearance.</p>
<p>Everybody jumped up. “Where <i>were</i> you children?” inquired Hilary from
Lilian’s embrace. “We thought you had missed a train or something.”</p>
<p>“No, Phil brought us in the auto, rather the chauffeur did, but Philip
was the official care-taker. Here he is, with Cathalina.”</p>
<p>Hilary was wondering how Lilian happened to come in the Van Buskirk car,
but there was no time to ask at this juncture.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Philip was saying to Cathalina, as they approached, “My,
Kitten, must I be introduced to all that bunch?”</p>
<p>“O, yes, and remember ’em, Phil, if you can. You know Hilary, of course,
and that is June, her little sister, and Evelyn is that graceful little
thing farthest away. You’ll know her by her Southern speech, and Helen,
too,—with her rather especial drawl. I don’t know the rest myself.
There’s Patty, too, just joining them.”</p>
<p>Evelyn’s eyes and lashes, drooping or raised, went into effect
immediately upon introduction, and Philip’s courtesy responded to her
grown-up ways; but as there were too many girls for one young gentleman
to entertain, he remained by Lilian most of the time, holding her extra
coat and hand-bag with entire content. At train time, however, Philip
helped as many of the girls as possible, settled them in the train,
shook hands all around, kissed Cathalina and swung himself off in good
time. Many girlish eyes followed him, and their last view was of a tall,
good-looking, dark-eyed boy, touching his hat and looking chiefly
at—Lilian.</p>
<p>“I never saw Phil so taken with a girl,” whispered Cathalina to Hilary
at the first chance. “We were motoring through and stopped all night at
Rochester, when whom should we meet at the hotel but Lilian and Judge
North. The Judge had business at Rochester and was going to put Lilian
on the train for Buffalo. We could have gone to Charlotte, of course, to
wait for the boat from Toronto, but both Lilian and I wanted the whole
trip with you girls. We had a fine visit yesterday as we drove,—I was so
glad for Mother to know our Lilian better, and Lilian was at her
brightest and sweetest and prettiest.”</p>
<p>“And that is rather attractive,” inserted Hilary.</p>
<p>“You can see that the Judge just loves her to pieces.”</p>
<p>No sooner was the party off the train at Niagara than a capable official
appeared. Arrangements were at once made with him to transport the party
by auto to the station from which they would next depart and to take
them upon the sight-seeing tour as soon as their baggage was safely
checked.</p>
<p>Through the park, to different points where the American or Canadian
Falls could best be seen, the girls rode or walked with little
conversation. They stood silently before the majesty of the waters,
watching the feathery flow over the American Falls, or a glittering
green cascade on the Canadian side. On little bridges which led to rocky
islands, they watched the whirling rapids above the falls. Sometimes the
mist blew into their faces.</p>
<p>“May we go under the falls, Miss West?”</p>
<p>“No, Marjorie; we’ll just do the safer, ordinary things.”</p>
<p>“That suits me,” said Hilary. “I want to look at the things the Creator
made. Everything else seems like a blot on the landscape, cheap,
someway.”</p>
<p>“Well, perhaps,” answer Helen. “Still, we could not see the Falls as
well if they did not have the bridges, you know. Wouldn’t you’ve liked
to be the first person that ever saw Niagara Falls?”</p>
<p>“Prob’ly some Indian.”</p>
<p>“Yes, June, that didn’t know what he was coming to and went over in his
little canoe!”</p>
<p>“Now, Marjorie!” reproved Helen. “You can hear the thunder of it a long
way off, and I’m sure that any sensible Indian would have landed his
canoe long before he came to the big rapids.”</p>
<p>The falls of Niagara never cease to arouse wonder and admiration no
matter how many times the tourist may have visited them, and these girls
were no exception to the rule. The amazing whirlpool rapids, where,
tossing and tumbling, the foaming waters of Niagara river swept through
the great gorge, impressed them almost as much as the falls themselves.
The day itself, with its fresh breeze and sun upon the dancing waters,
more than compensated for the tiresome trip of the night before.</p>
<p>Lewiston and a customs officer came next. At first the girls wondered
why the herding of the crowd through the little gate to the dock, but
the questions asked about their luggage made them realize that they were
temporarily leaving their native land. So unmistakable a group of
school-girls and teacher, however, with the camp tags on suit-cases and
bags, was passed on everywhere without any trouble. They were soon on
board the boat for Toronto.</p>
<p>Out of the Niagara River into Lake Ontario the steamer moved, and it was
not long before the water front of Toronto appeared through gathering
fog and evening shadows.</p>
<p>“Does Betty know that we’re coming tonight?”</p>
<p>“I think not, unless she looks up the time-tables. She knows that she is
to leave tomorrow afternoon, and that we are to be at the Queen’s Hotel.
You will have plenty of time to visit with Betty on the boat tomorrow
and the rest of the way,—let us have a good night’s rest, enjoy seeing
Toronto tomorrow morning,—”</p>
<p>“O, <i>please</i>, Miss West,” begged Cathalina. “Just let us call her up!”</p>
<p>“We shall see,” returned Miss West, weakening a little.</p>
<p>But by the time they had reached the Queen’s Hotel, nice conservative
old place with an English atmosphere and a “royal suite,” the girls only
wanted to get to bed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“I’m on foreign soil,” sleepily murmured June as Hilary tucked her in,
and Hilary herself was too sleepy to laugh.</p>

<p>When Lilian woke the next morning, she dreamily looked toward the light
of a grey, rainy morning and noticed the lace curtains stirring in the
breeze. “How appropriate,” thought she, “a crown and ‘The Queen’s’ woven
in the pattern.” She glanced at Hilary and June sleeping in the double
bed near. “Here we are, then, in Canada,” closing her eyes. “I wonder if
Philip will come up to camp as he said he would ... isn’t he fine?...
how dark his eyes are ... I wonder ...” and Lilian dozed off into an
enchanting dream of motoring somewhere with Philip Van Buskirk, not
waking till Cathalina, who fit nicely right into the dream, was shaking
her and saying, “Wake up, Canada Lily, do you know we’ll disgrace our
nation and not get down before the dining room closes!”</p>
<p>Rested from their warm baths and good sleep of the night, fresh, smiling
girls gathered in the breakfast room of “The Queen’s”. Miss West was
proud of them and their quiet, dignified behaviour.</p>
<p>“What do you think we had for breakfast, Mother?” wrote June a little
later. “<i>Strawberries</i> and cream—thick cream! Think of it, on the first
of July! I’m going to begin in March in Cincinnati and go north to
follow up the berries till the season ends in Canada. I ordered ‘oatmeal
porridge’ because it sounded so English, ‘bean porridge hot’, you
know,—and it was the best breakfast food I ever ate. They had ‘English
breakfast tea’ on the menu, too, but I couldn’t order that because I
wanted cocoa, m’m, so good! Some of the cocoa you get traveling is
horrid. But I’ll never forget those big, ripe, juicy berries that the
waiter brought me. I felt selfish because mine happened to be the
biggest. But you couldn’t change, of course, anyway, in public. Our
waiter looked just like the English valet I saw the other day in a
movie, so dignified and serious.</p>
<p>“I’ve gotten the traveler’s guide and things from the office and have
learned that Toronto was founded as a French trading post with the
Indians in 1749, and that it covers forty square miles. The name is from
an Indian word and means ‘place of meeting’. The land was ‘sold to the
Crown in 1787 by the Missisauga Indians for $85.’ Think of it. It is the
capital of the Province of Ontario and has a population of five hundred
thousand. I don’t suppose I shall remember this, but I promised Father
that I’d try to learn some little thing about each place. I may add some
more to this after we have taken our ride in the sight-seeing ’bus. Miss
West has the tickets already; you can get them right in the hotel. We
are to start about noon, for we had our breakfast so late that we shall
not want any lunch till at least two o’clock. We are all packed up now,
and leave on the boat about four o’clock, I think. We haven’t seen Betty
yet, or even called her up. When we started to, we found that nobody,
not even Cathalina, knew her aunt’s name or telephone number, but Betty
knows when we leave and I’m sure she will be here or at the boat on
time.”</p>
<p>“Come, girls,” said Miss West, “all ready for the trip and packed up to
start after lunch? We’ll go down to the lobby and see if the taxi has
arrived.”</p>
<p>And such an immense taxi it was. “I feel like a monkey,” declared Jean,
“climbing with both hands and feet up this tippy height!” The party
occupied only two of the long seats, and those in front had been
reserved for them. The man of the megaphone was hatless and active,
collecting the tickets as well as imparting information. “There are two
persons who have not surrendered their tickets,” he announced, counting
tickets and passengers.</p>
<p>Miss West looked up inquiringly. “I have all your tickets together,” he
assured her. As the same announcement was made several times later, the
girls concluded that it was a polite way of telling that two fares had
not been paid.</p>
<p>At once the girls noticed that the city was decorated with flags and
that the stores were closed. “This is Dominion Day,” announced the
megaphone, “same as your Fourth of July.” Everything was “Limited”,
“Imperial”, “Royal”, “Dominion”, or “Queen’s”, according to June. T.
Eaton’s seemed to be as important in Toronto as Marshall Field’s in
Chicago, and an unusual feature in which the girls were interested was
the display of pretty gowns or other articles for sale in the front or
bay windows of what had once been private residences, now absorbed into
the business part of the city.</p>
<p>“How do you feel, June,” asked Cathalina, “under the Union Jack?”</p>
<p>“All right. You’ve been in so many foreign countries that I suppose it
does not seem strange to you.”</p>
<p>“I never happened to be in Canada, and it is just as interesting as it
can be!”</p>
<p>Different monuments and churches, Queen’s Park, the University of
Toronto and the Parliament building engaged their attention, and as they
rode through Rosedale, a pretty residential section, the girls wondered
if Betty’s aunt lived there. At the hotel again, it was great fun to
trail after the porter who showed them the royal suite; but time was
pressing, and while Miss West settled the bills the girls started for
the dock, within easy walking distance. Still no Betty!</p>
<p>“I meant to get a picture of that funny little hotel ’bus,” said
Marjorie. “Is that our boat? Isn’t it cute?”</p>
<p>“You’ll be the death of me yet,” laughed Jean, “A steam-boat cute!”</p>
<p>“What’s its name?” continued Marjorie undisturbed.</p>
<p>“The Toronto; see?”</p>
<p>“Salve, Toronto! Vale, Toronto!” remarked Hilary.</p>
<p>“What does that mean?” asked June.</p>
<p>“It means ‘hail, Toronto,’ the boat, and ‘farewell, Toronto,’ the city.”</p>
<p>As they came nearer the dock, some one jumped out of a taxi and waved.
It was Betty at last.</p>
<p>“Why, Betty,—all alone?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss West, company came unexpectedly. I had a time to get packed
up at all. But fortunately Auntie had bought my tickets yesterday, and
my trunk came down this morning. I have been thinking of you all and
could hardly wait to see you, but Auntie said that you would be taking
in the city anyway. That was to console me.”</p>
<p>The girls were fortunate in getting seats out in the very front of the
deck. Their baggage had been taken to the little staterooms, cameras and
field glasses brought out, and they settled themselves in great content
for the trip by water from Toronto to Montreal. So far there had been so
much sight-seeing that the visiting had been only incidental, though by
this time the Greycliff girls felt pretty well acquainted with the three
girls—Marjorie, Jean and Rhoda—whom they had so recently met.</p>
<p>Betty and Cathalina compared their adventures since they had parted at
Greycliff.</p>
<p>“Mother said ‘how could she spare her little Betty so soon,’ for this
little visit to Auntie first, then for nearly all summer at camp, home
for just a peep at the folks, and school at Greycliff again!”</p>
<p>“Mine felt that way, too, but she said that it was a good opportunity
for me to have the experience of a girls’ camp, while so many of us
could be together and while we had darling old Patty to take care of
us.”</p>
<p>“O, there are lots of councillors to do that.”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course, but then we know Patty so well.”</p>
<p>“Is Isabel coming, or do you know, Cathalina?”</p>
<p>“Yes; I had a letter from her soon after she got home. Her father had
said that she could come. Did you know that Virginia Hope went home with
her for the summer?”</p>
<p>“No. I rushed off home, you know, the first minute I could. That was
lovely of Isabel, and of Mr. Hunt, too.”</p>
<p>“I suppose that Virginia will come to camp with Isabel, but she did not
say so, and it might be that Virginia made other plans later. We shall
know when we get there,—naturally.”</p>
<p>“There is Jean sitting by herself. Come on over here, Jean,” and Betty
hitched her chair along to make room for Jean’s.</p>
<p>“I was just dreaming and watching the water,” said Jean. “Don’t you love
it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I never get tired of it,” answered Cathalina, “but Betty and I
were talking about some of the girls we know at school.”</p>
<p>“O, yes; what is this ‘Greycliff’ you girls talk about?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid you would be sorry if we got started talking on that
subject, but it is a girls’ school, preparatory, with two years of
college work, and Patty, Miss West, you know, teaches there. That is how
some of us found out about camp, because she is a councillor there, too.
Betty and I, with Lilian and Hilary, are in a suite together. Phil calls
us the ‘suite quartet’, which is an awful pun. Philip is my brother,—O,
yes, you met him at Buffalo. Of course you know about Helen and Evelyn,
and we were just saying that perhaps two of the younger girls at
Greycliff—Isabel Hunt and Virginia Hope—would be at camp this summer.
Isabel wrote that she is coming, but did not speak of Virginia, and
Virginia is visiting there. She wrote a scrap of a letter only and did
not think of it, I suppose. Then there is another of our especial
friends whom we hope to see, Eloise Winthrop, a lovely girl that I’m
sure you will like.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it funny how you always get crazy about the school you go to?”</p>
<p>“O, I don’t know, Jean,” replied Betty. “You see Greycliff is unusual!”</p>
<p>“Last call for the first sitting.” Thus from time to time the different
dinner calls came. Dinner on the boat started at six o’clock, but the
girls had decided that they did not want tickets. This was contrary to
their usual custom, for Miss West considered that regular meals were a
necessary part of travel. But the late and excellent lunch at the
Queen’s, together with a fine supply of sandwiches and pickles brought
by Betty, and a quantity of fruit brought aboard by Miss West, made the
girls lose all interest in dinner.</p>
<p>“Besides, you know, we’d better be careful if we have to stay on the
boat all night.” This from Marjorie, as the girls were drawing their
chairs close together and Betty was passing out sandwiches and pickles.</p>
<p>“Don’t give her any more pickles, then, Betty.”</p>
<p>“All right, you shall have the rest, Jean. I love to see you so careful
of Marjorie!”</p>
<p>“Let’s stay out on deck as long as possible; may we, Miss West?”</p>
<p>“Just as long as you like tonight,” replied Patricia, who herself
enjoyed it outside. But they had nothing to dread, for the lake was
calm; no motion of the boat was felt except the throbbing of the engine.
Gulls flew high or low or rested on the water. It was cloudy and the
sun, round and orange, slowly sank through and below the clouds, leaving
for a little while a golden glow upon the water. The girls played a few
of the guessing games when it grew dark, but finally the time came when
the little god of dreams claimed his own. For some time June had been
sitting with her head on Hilary’s shoulders, when Miss West declared
that the procession for the staterooms would “now start”.</p>
<p>“Don’t ring the bell as I did,” admonished Jean, “I thought it was the
electric button. You pull down the light and press the button to ring.
After I made the mistake I locked the door and skipped out, so I
wouldn’t be there when the maid came.”</p>
<p>“You needn’t have worried. I was just across from you with my door
braced open to air the place, and nobody came.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Betty. You take a heavy load off my conscience!”</p>
<p>Nothing disturbed the serenity of the night. The girls were wakened by
an early stop at Kingston and soon found themselves taking breakfast
with the second “shift” in the dining-room. They were to transfer to the
other boat at Prescott, but the Toronto was going very slowly on account
of a heavy fog, and finally anchored for nearly an hour. When the fog
lifted, however, the girls found a bright day before them. The turning
of the capstan when the anchor was drawn up interested them not a
little. The transfer was made to the boat which was to take them through
the rapids.</p>
<p>From now on to Montreal the scenery was beautiful. It was the broad St.
Lawrence with its Thousand Islands and rapids. The Merrymeeting girls
were down in the dining-room when the first rapids were reached, and one
or two looked anxiously at Miss West, who smiled reassuringly, and soon
the churning waters were left behind, with nothing but one little
grinding scrape to remind any one of rocks as the boat went through.
“And perhaps that was our imagination,” admitted June, as they discussed
it later.</p>
<p>“I’m getting enough rocks at last,” remarked Hilary.</p>
<p>“Why, do you like them so much?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Rhoda, ever since we started into the St. Lawrence I’ve been
saying ‘I love Thy rocks and rills, Thy woods and templed hills’, even
if these are not all of my own country. Look. There seems to be a sort
of red rock as the foundation of the islands. There’s a dear little one
that I’d like to own. Think of a cottage there among the trees and a
place for the water birds to build in the rocks!”</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t like it in winter, would you?”</p>
<p>“No, nor in summer without a launch. But you mustn’t be so practical,
Cathalina, can’t one have a little fancy?”</p>
<p>“Dear old Hilary! Purr-rr! Her shall have her little island!”</p>
<p>“Campbell likes the water, too. Wouldn’t Thousand Islands be a lovely
place for a honeymoon?”</p>
<p>“Sh-sh, Lilian, the other girls might hear and Hilary wouldn’t like it.”</p>
<p>“I should think Hilary wouldn’t,” commented the young lady herself.
“Please, girls, why are you so silly?”</p>
<p>“Well,” said Lilian, “when a certain young man finds out that a certain
young lady is going to a camp and immediately takes steps to get himself
appointed as councillor at a camp very near and under the same
management, it looks as if there were some connection anyhow!”</p>
<p>Hilary smiled, but made a little pouting face at Lilian, as she moved
over to where Marjorie and Rhoda were focusing their field glasses on
more rapids ahead.</p>
<p>“O, the most interesting thing, Hilary,” cried June. “I heard a
gentleman tell his wife that there is only one pilot who can take the
boat through the rapids, and he has to go up every day to do it. He
learned it from his father, and his son is watching him to learn how.”</p>
<p>“And did you notice,” said Rhoda, “how he pointed out the ‘American’ or
the ‘Canadian’ side? They are Canadians, too. It seems funny to me, for
they are in America as much as we are.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Hilary, “but the books do it. It seems to be general.”</p>
<p>“Look,” said Marjorie. “See how the steamer changes its course, always
going in the more quiet water. I can pretty nearly tell where we’ll go.
See the water tumbling over there! Big rocks, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Yes, and did you hear the man say what a descent there is?—I can feel
the boat going down hill!”</p>
<p>“We are really and truly shooting the rapids,” said June with great
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Mt. Royal, from which Montreal takes its name, could be seen long before
the last rapids were reached. Everybody was invited to the front of the
boat while an official talked about the rapids, the Indian village on
their right, and other points of interest. Safely through the Lachine
Rapids the boat glided and reached Montreal at last. Some of the girls
in the crowded motor ’bus, a few in a rickety victoria, the Merrymeeting
party rode to the hotel where they were to remain two nights.</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>It was eleven o’clock the next morning before the girls were finally
rounded up for breakfast or lunch, as they might choose to call it. For
this they went to an attractive place not far from the hotel where June
again found ripe strawberries, big and luscious.</p>
<p>“You’ll turn into a strawberry, June,” said Hilary, but June only
pointed to the dishes of the same natural product on all the other trays
in the cafeteria procession, as she replied, “I don’t eat so many more
than the rest of you,—I just say more about it.”</p>
<p>“By the way, Miss West,” continued Hilary, “we’re going in victorias,
aren’t we?”</p>
<p>“How many vote for victorias?” asked Patricia, “hands up.” Every hand at
the little table went up, and as the girls at the table close by had
heard the question, theirs as well were lifted.</p>
<p>“It is already arranged. Several of you had spoken of it—victorias it
is. Now for shopping. I will go with Marjorie, Jean and Rhoda, for they
seem to have the most to do. The rest of you meet us at the hotel in not
less than an hour. There is a drug store right here on the corner, a
department store half block in that direction. Keep in mind this corner
and the way to the hotel. Hilary, you are in charge.”</p>
<p>Hilary pretended to be much honored and the rest of the girls began to
joke her by asking if they might do the most obviously proper things.
But they had little shopping to do and arranged to meet at the entrance
of the big store.</p>
<p>“Listen,” said Cathalina, as they were returning to the hotel. “That boy
has a French paper. I’m going to get one. I had no idea that Montreal
was so French, though I heard some French spoken on the boat, of
course.”</p>
<p>“I heard a lady say that Montreal is fifty per cent French, and that of
that fifty per cent ninety per cent can not speak English.”</p>
<p>“No wonder, then, Betty, that they have both French and English on the
shop signs. I should like to spend a summer up here some time. No need
of going abroad to keep up your French!” Later, Cathalina discovered
that McGill University has many such summer pupils.</p>
<p>Duly at two-thirty, three victorias, drivers high in the air, rolled
away from the hotel to see the Canadian city of Montreal.</p>
<p>“O, I feel so English,” sighed Marjorie.</p>
<p>“Me, too,” said Rhoda, “but I think they ought to be called ‘Queen
Marys’ now instead of victorias!”</p>
<p>“Did you notice, Rhoda,” drawled Helen, “what our elderly waiter said to
you last night?”</p>
<p>“About my ‘’am sandwich’? Wasn’t I good not even to smile?”</p>
<p>“You were indeed, and so were the rest of us, I think, though Lil gave
me one look that almost upset me. She kept as sober as an owl, of
course. I didn’t want to make fun of any one, but I never heard the h’s
dropped, outside of a book or a movie.”</p>
<p>“Did you ever <i>hear</i> it in either?”</p>
<p>“Well, you know what I mean!”</p>
<p>“Gently, girls, the driver might hear you,” warned Miss Patty, who made
the fourth passenger in this vehicle.</p>
<p>The first place at which the driver stopped was in front of Notre Dame
Cathedral. The girls ran up the broad stone steps which led to the
entrance. Silently they entered, viewed the brilliant interior, the
altars and shrines with their candles, walked quietly down the aisle to
the right past a kneeling worshipper who was telling her beads before a
shrine, and into a part of the building to the rear of the altar.</p>
<p>“I can translate that,” whispered Marjorie to Cathalina as they looked
at the inscriptions upon the wall. “‘Silence in the holy place’.”
(Silence dans le lieu saint.)</p>
<p>“Notice the Latin inscriptions, too,—‘Oculos ad nos converte’—”</p>
<p>Hilary lingered a little to drop a coin into a box and came out with her
eyes full of tears. “I’ve been brought up in another kind of service,”
she explained to June, “but this touches me some way.”</p>
<p>“It’s the Lord’s house,” replied June solemnly.</p>
<p>“And some people’s faith and hope.”</p>
<p>“Des Jardins,” read Cathalina on the windows of a store where the
victorias were stopping. “I did not catch what the man said and I was in
the last victoria,” she explained later to one of the party, “so imagine
my surprise, after having translated it ‘gardens’ and expecting to find
flowers, to see this wonderful fur store.”</p>
<p>A great display of furs it was. The girls all longed to buy some at the
summer prices, but had not planned for any large expenditures on this
trip.</p>
<p>“Mother usually buys her furs up north,” said Betty, “since Auntie lives
there, you know.”</p>
<p>“Look at the darling white moccasins!” Hilary and June immediately
decided to purchase a pair for Mary, and several of the party bought the
bead-trimmed, leather moccasins before they left Montreal.</p>
<p>The ascent of Mt. Royal was made by easy stages, around a beautiful,
winding drive, past rocks and grassy slopes, interesting varieties of
trees and bushes, skirting a bridle path part of the way, till finally
the “look out”, “La Terrasse d’Observatoire au Mont-Royal” was reached
and a fine view of the city and river obtained.</p>
<p>“Just see me come up here some summer,” said Cathalina, as she leaned
upon the parapet next to Betty, “and read French while I live in some
French family and talk it all the time.”</p>
<p>When evening came, it was decided that in view of the long trip the next
day no outside entertainment should be sought.</p>
<p>“Let’s make it unanimous for bed,” suggested Hilary, who intended in any
event to see that June was early in the land of dreams.</p>
<p>“I vote with Hilary,” said Jean. “My brain can’t hold so much at one
time. I can’t remember all I’ve seen today!”</p>
<p>Helen, Evelyn and the three younger girls were with Miss West in a suite
of two rooms and bath. Hilary with June and Lilian, and Betty with
Cathalina were in adjoining rooms not far away. Like the girls, Patricia
dropped to sleep early, thinking about how perfectly everything was
going about the trip, and how lovely and sensible her girls were. “And
Cathalina has had so much experience in traveling.” But if she had known
what was happening that night scarcely the proverbial forty winks would
have been hers.</p>
<p>Waking early, and dozing uneasily for a while for fear that she would
oversleep, Miss West rose and dressed, wakened the girls that were with
her, saw that they were really roused and getting ready, and went to
call the rest. In the room occupied by Cathalina and Betty she heard
voices as she tapped on the door. “Up already, are you?” she said, as
Betty, fully dressed, threw open the door and several somewhat excited
voices began, “O, Miss West,—”</p>
<p>“Where did you find the pocketbook?” Hilary was asking Cathalina.</p>
<p>“Right there, on the floor.”</p>
<p>“And was nothing but the money gone?”</p>
<p>“That was all.” Cathalina was quite cool.</p>
<p>“What is this?” asked Patricia.</p>
<p>“Why, Miss Patricia, I seem to have been robbed last night,—but don’t
worry. I don’t mind, really, though I wish I’d spent it yesterday!”</p>
<p>Miss West sat down on the bed. “Do you mean to tell me that your room
was broken into last night? Tell me all about it. Did you wake up and
see the robber?”</p>
<p>“Mercy, I hadn’t thought that we might! Wouldn’t it have been terrible?
There isn’t much to tell. You see we didn’t lock the door—”</p>
<p>“I thought you girls always did that.—O, if I had only come and tucked
you all in!”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t your fault at all, and really we meant to lock the door as
usual. Indeed we do lock it, Miss West. You see, we were waiting for ice
water and got too sleepy to have any sense, I guess. We rang and the boy
didn’t come, and then we waited a while and were just nearly falling
over with sleep,—”</p>
<p>“After being out in the air all day,” inserted Betty.</p>
<p>“But your door should have been locked until he came.”</p>
<p>“Yes; we didn’t know it wasn’t. I put a tip on the table to have it
ready, and I finally crawled into bed with my Kimono on, after ringing
again,—and I woke up with it on this morning! The door was wide open, my
purse on the floor and the money gone. Please don’t scold, Miss West;
truly we won’t be so careless again.”</p>
<p>“My dear, I never felt less like scolding, and am only too thankful that
nothing happened to you and that you were not awakened or frightened.
But it is odd, Cathalina, for I thought of going in again to see if you
were all right, then I thought ‘Cathalina has traveled so much that she
will let me know if they need anything’ and went off to sleep more
peacefully than usual! Do you remember how much was in the purse?”</p>
<p>“About twenty dollars, I think. I have some besides, that wasn’t in the
pocketbook, and my check-book.”</p>
<p>“I was going to say that I can attend to all your expenses, of course.”</p>
<p>“Shall I write Mother about it?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t send a telegram,” Betty suggested with a laugh.</p>
<p>“When you get safely into camp she will not worry. You can write the
details then. It is safely over now and will teach us all a lesson in
making sure that it is not too easy for some thief to get our money.”</p>
<p>“It must be great to have your own check-book and money in the bank,”
whispered June to Hilary. “Is Cathalina awful rich?”</p>
<p>“‘Very,’ not ‘awful,’” corrected June’s elder sister. “Yes, you know how
much I have told you about their lovely home and servants and
everything. Cathalina has about everything she wants.”</p>
<p>“I will speak to the hotel people about it, but I fancy that we shall
never see the money,” Miss West was saying to Cathalina. “Perhaps we can
find out whether the bellboy ever came or not.”</p>
<p>There was little time for any detective work. Breakfast must be eaten,
bags packed, and an early departure made to the train. Cathalina
dismissed the matter, and by the time the party was on the train bound
for Portland everybody else seemed to have forgotten it. Patricia had an
occasional shiver whenever she thought of her sleeping girls with their
door opened by some prowler, but the necessary arrangements of the
present often most fortunately crowd out the too vivid memory of some
unpleasant occurrence.</p>
<p>“Here’s our last look at Montreal,” said Evelyn, as the train drew away
from the city. “There are two square towers of Notre Dame.”</p>
<p>“Goodbye, Mt. Royal,” and June waved her hand blithely. Too many good
times were ahead of them all for regrets.</p>
<p>“This is the Canadian Pacific bridge, I suppose,” said Rhoda, “that we
saw when we came down the river,—yes, there is the Indian village that
hasn’t any streets.”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen my last French sign, I guess,” remarked Cathalina. “It was at
the crossing. ‘Traverse Du Chemin De Fer’ was one cross-piece and
‘Railroad Crossing’ on the other.”</p>
<p>They were comfortably settled for the all day trip to Portland in a
chair car and looked very serious when an official appeared to ask them
if they had bought anything in Canada. They began to open their
suit-cases or bags and told of their moccasins at once, but in their
sincere faces the most suspicious of custom officers could find no
guile.</p>
<p>“It’s the Green Mountains that we see first, girls, then the White
Mountains. The conductor said so.” Jean was looking at the map in her
folder. “And we’re not in the United States right away after crossing
the St. Lawrence.”</p>
<p>As Hawthorne’s Tales of the White Hills are usually read in that
department of school work known as “English”, these girls were quite
interested in finding, among post cards bought on the train, a
photograph of the “Great Stone Face”. “I hadn’t thought of it myself,”
said Patty, “that these are Hawthorne’s White Hills at last.”</p>
<p>“This scenery is the most lovely of all we have seen,” said Lilian.</p>
<p>They had been watching the clouds floating about the hill-tops, little
cascades leaping down the rugged heights, pretty glens, little streams,
lakes and rocky cliffs. Yet beautiful as the scenery was, no one could
keep in a state of rapture all the time. At intervals Cathalina read her
French papers. Other papers and magazines were passed around, or the
girls chatted happily about many things. It was a day to be remembered,
and interesting to have celebrated “Dominion Day” in Canada, this
“glorious Fourth”, or most of it, in New England.</p>
<p>“What do you think about it, girls?” asked Miss West of a few near her,
as they were nearing Portland. “Was it worth the trouble to take the
trip?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have missed it for anything,” cried Marjorie, and seemed to
express the general sentiment.</p>
<p>A sight-seeing trip in Portland the next day showed them its buildings
and parks, and Casco Bay with its schooners, sail-boats and freighters
of all sorts. On Congress Street they saw the home of Longfellow, “next
to Keith’s!” This struck the girls as particularly funny. “‘From the
sublime to the ridiculous’ both literally and figuratively,” said
Hilary.</p>
<p>The journey to Bath seemed incredibly short in comparison with the long
trips which they had been having. It was the Maine country, with its
buttercups, daisies, wild roses, evergreens, and the aged rocks peeping
out here and there,—and now they had arrived at Bath, with nothing but a
boat ride between them and camp!</p>

</div>
<p>“Our luck has turned, girls; it poured at Portland and is drizzling
here!”</p>
<p>“But we’ve had lovely days for all the important sight-seeing. Do you
remember how perfectly bright and wonderful it was that day on the St.
Lawrence? The water sparkled and foamed, and the sky was so blue,—”</p>
<p>“Listen to Lilian, our optimist,” spoke Hilary. “She’s our mascot for
good weather. By the way, Miss West, I have to get some sneakers and a
bathing cap in Bath.”</p>
<p>“So do I,” said Evelyn and Betty together, whereat they turned, made
mysterious signs and repeated “thumbs” together.</p>
<p>“How many million years have girls done that?” asked Patricia. “We shall
have quite a little shopping to do at Bath, but all the stores are near
together. I need ink, some tablets and magazines. Whoever comes down the
river for us will probably have a lot of errands to do, as usual. We’ll
do ours and then go down to the dock and wait. It will not be later than
four o’clock, I think, when we start up the river.”</p>
<p>It was the little Papoose from the boys’ camp that came for them. On
account of the drizzle, the canopy was up, an affair not unlike the top
of a prairie schooner, but, alas, not as high. Some of the occupants had
to assume a bending posture. Helen declared that she had a “puhmahnent
cuhve” in her back, and for weeks Hilary referred to the submarine stunt
of their first arrival. But it was fun to peep out at the water, the
rocks, and the green trees that lined the banks, and the Papoose safely
chugged her way to Merrymeeting.</p>
<p>“Here we are; hooray for Merrymeeting!” cried Jean, as she stepped upon
Merrymeeting’s floating dock and ran lightly up to the more solid
portion above the washing of tides; for the Kennebec is affected by the
sea tides, and as far up as Merrymeeting Bay there is a difference of
from six to eight feet in the depth of the water, according to the tide.</p>
<p>Up the little rise they filed to the level ground which stretches
broadly at the river front and holds the big dining hall and the boat
house; then again they proceeded up the gradual ascent to the Club
House, which is the center of Merrymeeting life. There the girls were
welcomed and assigned to the different “Klondikes” or cottages. The
other campers and councillors had only arrived at noon, hence a scene of
great activity. Basins and pitchers were being given out. Cots and
mattresses were being placed or changed in tents and klondikes. Trunks
were being delivered and directions of all sorts given. In spite of the
damp grass and misty atmosphere, everybody seemed happy, the old campers
glad to get back.</p>
<p>“You don’t know how lovely it is here,” said one and another to the new
comers. “Wait till the sun comes out!”</p>
<p>Already Marjorie, Jean and Rhoda had joined girls whom they knew in
school in Cincinnati. Hilary knew a few more of them, though she had not
lived there very long. The Greycliff girls had asked to be together, but
Patricia explained that assignments were usually made on account of age.
“We have Seniors, Intermediates and Juniors. And then you don’t want to
be in a separate group, do you? There are girls from several different
private schools and high schools in different cities, East and West. You
will lose sight of other organizations and just be Merrymeeting campers
together.”</p>
<p>“That is much better,” acknowledged Hilary at once. “I did not think of
it. Of course we don’t want to be a little club by ourselves!”</p>
<p>“However,” continued Patricia, “for another reason I want to put you
four Greycliff room-mates together. Helen and Evelyn are to be together
in a different klondike. June will have to go to ‘Laugh-a-Lot,’ and I
shall be there, for a while at least.”</p>
<p>“O, good!” exclaimed June, who had felt a slight qualm at the idea of
being separated from Hilary.</p>
<p>“Here, Frances Anderson,” called Patricia to a tall, fine-looking girl
who was passing. “Aren’t you at Squirrels’ Inn? I thought so. Please
show these girls where it is—Hilary Lancaster, Cathalina Van Buskirk,
Lilian North and Betty Barnes,—” with which brief introduction Miss West
was off to see about some affairs of her own, June’s hand tucked under
her arm.</p>
<p>“Squirrels’ Inn!” exclaimed Lilian. “Our future residence?”</p>
<p>Frances was friendly and enjoyed initiating the girls into the way of
camp. They stood chatting a few minutes, then moved on over the wrinkled
gray rocks and grass around the Club House toward Squirrels’ Inn. But a
gay voice called them before they had gone far.</p>
<p>“Cathalina Van Buskirk! Hil and Lil! Betty! O, joy!” From the “Wiggly”
side of the double cottage called Piggly-Wiggly, who should come running
but Isabel! “Have you seen Eloise? She’s down at her klondike getting
settled.”</p>
<p>“At Squirrels’ Inn?”</p>
<p>“No; the one down by the pine grove. May I come over with you? I was
just over with Eloise and met Helen and Evelyn going to the same
cottage. There are a lot of girls down there. We’ve got a house full
too. Such doings! I’m crazy about this place already.”</p>
<p>On to Squirrels’ Inn they went and met their young councillor, with two
more girls, Marion Thurman and Nora McNeil. A busy time followed. This
klondike at first arranged its cots on one side and trunks on the other.
Wiggly, where Isabel escorted the girls later, had a cot and its trunk,
then another cot with its accompanying trunk, and so on, around the big
room. “I like your cottage,” said Isabel, “because it has that back
porch hanging over the hillside, so convenient for drying or sunning
bathing suits or bathrobes.”</p>
<p>“Trust Isabel for finding all about a place in a few hours,” remarked
Cathalina. “It would be a month before half that Isabel sees in two
minutes would make any impression on me.”</p>
<p>“Why, I thought you had traveled a good deal, Cathalina; don’t you
notice things?”</p>
<p>“Yes, what I’m interested in, but Isabel sees everything.”</p>
<p>“O, Mother only put in two sheets!” This came from Betty, who was diving
into her trunk. “Yes, here are some more.”</p>
<p>“My, Cathalina, your steamer rug looks nice over your cot!”</p>
<p>“I’ve got a big grey army blanket.”</p>
<p>“Just look at Betty’s Indian blanket! Who gave it to you, Betty?”</p>
<p>“My Aunt; I got it this summer in Canada.”</p>
<p>“I think we’d better spread our ponchos over our cots, don’t you? It’s
so damp tonight.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t any.”</p>
<p>“Very likely there are some at the office that you can buy. You’ll
probably want one.”</p>
<p>“I have a good rain-coat.”</p>
<p>“Just the thing; spread that over your blankets tonight.”</p>
<p>“There’s the supper bell. We have dinner at noon, supper at six. Come
on, that’s the second bell.”</p>
<p>The old farm bell hung high, as it had when Merrymeeting was a farm and
was swinging and ringing cheerfully, while one of the little girls
pulled the rope, by orders from headquarters. Down hill the girls ran or
walked to the big dining-room with its long tables.</p>
<p>“We can look right out on the lake, can’t we?” said Betty.</p>
<p>“River, you mean, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course; but doesn’t it make you think of a lake someway? It is
so broad here.”</p>
<p>“It makes me think more of the St. Lawrence,” said Cathalina, “with the
islands and the rocks and the pretty rippling water.”</p>
<p>“Those little islands are the Burnt Jackets. Didn’t you notice that your
boat rocked a little coming through the Burnt Jackets? The Indians named
them.”</p>
<p>At supper it was announced that the first Camp Fire would be at the Club
House shortly. The bell would ring. Duly the big family assembled,
stopping, many of them to look at the glorious rainbow which was
appearing in the East. “O, it’s double, girls!” said Isabel.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you ever see anything like that before?” asked one superior
damsel, going on inside.</p>
<p>“Chile, dat means it’s goin’ to cleah up,” replied Evelyn in her best
dialect.</p>
<p>Within it seemed like bedlam for a while till a whistle blew and one of
the older girls took charge as leader of songs and cheers, and one of
the councillors who sat on the floor among the girls tuned up her “light
guitar”. There was a piano, but it was not used at this first Camp Fire.
In the big fireplace the wood fire glowed and cracked, drying a long
line of shoes which stood before it, filling the Assembly Hall with
comfort and good cheer, and reminding some of the campers from the hot
cities that they were up in Maine.</p>
<p>“A few things to be remembered, girls,” said the head councillor. “The
first bell in the morning will be for the dip, at seven o’clock, but
there will be none tomorrow morning, not until the next Friday morning.
At five minutes of eight the bell rings for setting up exercises. Come
promptly, down by the dining-room. Breakfast is at eight. Right after
breakfast you go back to your klondikes to get them in order for
inspection. You receive a certain number of points for neat order and a
banner goes every week to the most orderly klondike.</p>
<p>“The plans for the games and the teams will be announced. We are going
to have all kinds of good times. You all have a special place to fit in
and will be on a team. There will be a hare and hounds chase soon, a
Mystery Hunt that I can not tell you about or it would not be a mystery,
tournaments and a swimming meet and a picnic down at the boys’ island.
Until the canoe tests no one is allowed to go out in a canoe. And only
in groups of three or more may you go into the pine grove. We never have
had prowlers, but take no chances. No girl ever goes off the grounds,
and your councillor should always know where you are.”</p>
<p>“About the candy, please?”</p>
<p>“When any candy is received in camp, the girl is called to the office,
opens the box herself, is given half a pound and the rest goes into the
general supply. Occasionally a dish of candy will be on each table at
the dining-room. And by the way, Lilian North has the first box of
candy. Go and get it for her, Frances. Come, Lilian, it came before you
arrived. You may open it and pass it around now if you like.”</p>
<p>It was quite evident that the box was a surprise to Lilian, but she rose
to the occasion, opened the big box on the table in the little room at
the end of the assembly hall, slipped the card it contained into her
sweater pocket, and amid applause and cries of “What’s the matter with
Lilian North?” or “Speech, speech!” passed the box around, first
throwing little handfuls of bonbons into the laps and upstretched hands
of the smaller children.</p>
<p>“My, your father is good to you!” exclaimed June innocently, as Lilian
sat down by her chums again. Hilary looked mischievous and Cathalina
pretended to lean against Betty for support. Lilian’s cheeks were rosy
with blushes, but she carried it off well and kept her hand on the card
in her pocket till she should have a good chance to look at it
privately.</p>
<p>“Everybody in on this yell!” announced the cheer leader:</p>

</div>
<p style='text-indent:0'>July 6, Thursday.</p>
<p>I see that this little book is going to be full before the summer is
over. It is just as well that Father gave me this pretty diary with the
key, for some of the things I shall write will be very private and
special. I do not believe, though, that I shall write out my thoughts
much. I did that once, and they seem so silly afterwards, when you have
gotten older. However, I’m nearly grown up now.</p>
<p>Last night there was a gorgeous rainbow and this morning when we started
down to breakfast every little spider had its cobweb out, (tune of
“ev’ry little wave had its white cap on, white cap, night cap, white cap
on”), and that means a nice day. Sure enough, it wasn’t long before the
sun shone out and showed how perfectly lovely it is up here. I’m wild
about the scenery. One of the councillors said that the bay looked like
“liquid sapphire”, which was very good indeed, for it reflected the blue
of the sky. I’ll try “liquid sapphire” in a “pome” sometime.
Merrymeeting Bay is on our right, to the west of our point, and is where
five rivers meet. It certainly does look funny to see the current, or
apparently the current, going the wrong way between our point and that
of the mainland opposite on into the bay. I thought at first this
morning that the way I had considered down stream must be up stream and
that I had been turned around as to directions. But I soon found that
this was only the tide coming in! We are six or seven miles from Bath
and almost fourteen from the sea, I believe. There is the dearest island
just inside the bay. Somebody lives there, for we see a house and boat.</p>
<p>The girls call the gymnastic exercise that we have just before going in
to breakfast the “upsetting exercises”. It is fun, for the athletic
director gives us some exercises different from any I ever had before.
My voice lessons have made me able to do the deep breathing performances
easily. I didn’t take much gym last year in school, had too much else to
do, or thought I had.</p>
<p>At breakfast there were some announcements, about how many points one
makes in the different things, for orderly klondike, for being quiet in
rest hour, and after the last bell rings at night. I couldn’t begin to
remember it all. But I can find out gradually, I think. Then we get
points for hikes and the games, and for bringing in the wild flowers and
identifying new birds. I’m going to see how many I can make. Each year
there is a silver cup given to the best all around camper among the
seniors, among the juniors and among the intermediates, and on your
head-band you can have the cutest things for what you have done. Frances
had so many on the one she got last year. Everybody has M. C., for
Merrymeeting Camp, and two cunnin’ little pine trees on each side of
those letters. Frances has a tennis racquet, a volley ball, a baseball,
a paddle, a shoe (for hiking), and the dearest little musical notes. I
think I can get the notes, and I’m pretty good at tennis, though I’ve
never played the other games. Old Hilary will shine in basketball. How
I’d love to get the Merrymeeting ring or a pin, but not very many get
those, I guess. You can not buy them, just win them.</p>
<p>At eleven o’clock we had our first swim, in the cove by the pine grove.
That makes a good rhyme and I’m going to put it in a song perhaps. It is
the most fascinating place! You feel like an Indian stepping on those
generations of pine needles and do not make a bit of noise. There is a
narrow winding path with sweet fern and other ferns and green moss and
all sorts of pretty things by it, just before you get in under the
thickest trees. Then you climb down over roots and stones to the big
rocks that line the cove. This is almost a complete circle of rocks,
well, there is quite a space where they have a rope and pole beyond
which the girls do not go. Cathalina said we all looked like mermaids.
She didn’t go in this morning as she took a bit of cold on the boat. The
swimming teacher was there and in a boat near were two more of our
gentlemen, ready to rescue us, I suppose, if we did anything foolish.
The girls who can not swim paddled around where the water is shallow. It
is only at high tide that the cove is well filled, they say. We have a
swimming teacher, an athletic director, a doctor, a nurse, and more
interesting folks that I do not know yet. All the girls that I have met
are pleasant and friendly and are of all descriptions as to size and
looks. Some of them are tutoring a little with some of the councillors.</p>
<p>Now the most interesting thing of all. I had a box of candy from Philip
Van Buskirk. It seemed to be a four or five-pound box and was full of
the most delicious kinds that just melted in your mouth. Philip
certainly does know how to choose candy. It was sent from New York and
he must have mailed it as soon as he got home. Word was sent me from the
office by one of the little girls that a box was there for me, but I
thought that it was just the middies that were to come from home, and in
the midst of getting settled I forgot about it till it was announced at
the Camp Fire and the box brought in. It flashed over me that perhaps
Phil had sent it, because he had been so perfectly lovely to me from the
time we met at Rochester. We talked music and other things almost
steadily or we all sang together and Phil has a perfectly adorable
voice. And when he put down my coat and things on the train as we
started to Niagara he bent down and said close to my ear, “You are going
to hear from me soon.” I looked up at him and laughed, and just then
Cathalina spoke to him.</p>
<p>Philip has been brought up to do all the nice things that gentlemen do
when they can, but I don’t believe that he is a flirtatious boy and I do
believe that he really likes me and that we can be good chums whenever
we meet. I am crazy to hear him play. Imagine having him play an
accompaniment for me!</p>
<p>But I’m not finishing about the box. I slipped the card quickly into my
pocket and looked at it afterward. “Philip Van Buskirk” looked so
distinguished, and so does he, for that matter. The girls were lovely,
did not ask me a word about it, although I know Hilary was dying to be
sure that it was from Philip. He is very kind indeed, but there is no
reason for being silly about it. He probably sends candy to other girls.
His manners are just perfect, and he seems so grown up and serious, some
way. I ought to write a little note of thanks, I suppose, or would it do
to tell Cathalina,—no, that wouldn’t do. O, I didn’t bring a bit of real
good stationery along! I refused to write to any of the boys at home,
said I wouldn’t have time but would send cards to the entire crowd. They
were all so good to me the short time I was home.</p>
<p>This afternoon the girls had a circus in the big barn and initiated all
of us new girls. It was a circus, indeed! Some of them were painted up
as clowns and looked perfectly killing. The old girls got it up with the
help of the athletic director. We girls sat on the hay in the high mow
and slid down or climbed down when wanted to take the center of the
“stage”, which was on the main floor, also covered with hay. Some of the
stunts were very funny. Hilary and I had to sit down back to back, with
our arms locked,—in each other’s,—and then we were to rise. We couldn’t
do it at all and got to laughing so that we just fell over in the hay!
Several other pairs of the ones to be initiated tried it and we all
declared that it couldn’t be done. Then it was announced that two
councillors would try it and show us how it could be done. We thought
that it would be a joke on the two councillors that were asked, but
didn’t they do it, though not without some trying! There was great
applause.</p>
<p>We had some visitors up from the boys’ camp and Brushwood Lodge, where
fathers and mothers can stay. Some of their councillors were up, but we
didn’t see anything of Campbell. If Hilary teases about Philip, I must
not forget Campbell’s interest in her!</p>
<p>As Isabel says, “more anon”. I’m afraid that this will be a scrappy
diary. I’m sitting on my cot to write. Nobody is in the klondike now,
but Nora McNeil, whom some of the girls call “Pat” or “Irish”. I think
that sounds a little too much like boys. Not many of the girls have
nicknames, but those that have do not seem to mind it.</p>
<p>It must be nearly time for the supper bell,—yes, there it is.</p>
<hr class='tbk' />
<p>Isabel ran in at this moment and carried Lilian off with her. “I brought
over Cathalina’s sweater. She left it in Wiggly after the circus. Say,
Lilian, I’ve counted eighteen canoes beside the war canoe. It holds
seventeen by actual count of seats. Aren’t they the prettiest
things?—that deep blue and all painted up new!”</p>
<p>“You are like Shakespeare, Isabel, closing up your speech with two lines
that rhyme.”</p>
<p>“What?—O, ‘blue’ and ‘new’. Yes, I’m a great poet.”</p>
<p>“Can you paddle, Isabel?”</p>
<p>“Just a little, but I want to learn to do it well. I can swim if I do
tip over, but I want to be an expert, ha-ha!” and Isabel struck an
attitude of great dignity.</p>
<p>“I think that most of the Greycliff girls can swim, but I want to get
the strokes that this teacher will give us. I do think it important to
be a good swimmer if you have the opportunity to learn. Father will be
so delighted if I do these things.”</p>
<p>“We’ve been assigned to tables. Goodbye; I must hunt mine up.”</p>
<p>Lilian found herself with a new councillor and a group of girls entirely
unknown to her, but it does not take long for campers with common
interests to become acquainted.</p>
<p>“Who serves first?” asked one.</p>
<p>“The girls next to me,” replied the councillor. “Two serve for three
meals, then two others the next day, and so on, moving around the
table.” Little girls, as little used to responsibility as Cathalina had
been, took hold as cheerfully as could be, and brought in plates of
bread and butter, pitchers of milk, dishes of steaming potatoes or
platters of well-browned fish.</p>
<p>“Did you see the big fish?” asked one of the girls.</p>
<p>“No; what fish?”</p>
<p>“There was a four hundred-pound sturgeon caught up the river.”</p>
<p>“Four hundred pounds! You are joking.”</p>
<p>“No, indeed. We asked how they got it into the boat, and they said it
was just like a log, too heavy to fight. They cut it up and shipped it
to Bath in a barrel!”</p>
<p>“What a fish story!”</p>
<p>“No, honest, some people that live on the river caught it.”</p>
<p>“Ting-a-ling,” the bell at the head councillor’s table. First a bird
hike was announced for an early hour the next morning, the bell to ring
at a quarter to six. Our Greycliff quartet especially gave attention to
this and nodded at each other as members of the Greycliff bird club.</p>
<p>The next announcement created universal joy and was to the effect that
the Aeolus and Truant would take out the campers for a ride on the river
and that the girls who had been at Merrymeeting before and could paddle
might take out the war canoe. There was great applause and a hurrying on
the part of the experienced paddlers to select paddles and run or slide
down to the dock.</p>
<p>As Lilian and Hilary walked down, one little girl came up the hill
crying. “O,” said Lilian, “what is the matter?”</p>
<p>No response.</p>
<p>“Come on with me and have a good time,” said Lilian coaxingly.</p>
<p>A councillor appeared hurrying up the slight ascent after the child.
“She is homesick,” she explained, “and when she thought she could not
sit by me she said she wouldn’t go.” Kindly the young councillor led her
along and finally got her on the boat. The girls saw her later,
contentedly watching the gulls which flew about the landing as the boats
started.</p>
<p>Everybody had been longing to get out on the water on this ideal day.
Blue, rosy or golden, the sunset colors stained the waters with like
reflected hues. The start of the war canoe was funny indeed. No one was
in practice and as Isabel said, the paddles were going in ragtime in
spite of the regularly called time. But by the time they were fairly out
in the river the paddles swept in unison. Girls sat both within and on
top of the Aeolus, and out on the front and rear of the Truant. A pretty
sight it was as they floated out into the sunset, and there we may leave
them, knowing that we shall find them in their klondikes in the morning.</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>Squirrels’ Inn contained a congenial group. There were the four
Greycliff girls, Cathalina, Hilary, Lilian and Betty, with whose
characters and talents we are fairly familiar by this time. Frances
Anderson was one of the strongest girls in camp, a good, all-round,
dependable girl, having ideas of her own, but what the girls called a
“good sport”.</p>
<p>Nora McNeil was as tall as Frances and had soft, fluffy black hair, big
blue eyes, and the complexion that goes with this Irish combination. She
was slight and active, as happy as the rest to be in camp, for this was
her first year, too, and she was experiencing all the thrills of a first
time.</p>
<p>Marion Thurman was an Eastern girl, using the soft a’s, the r’s omitted
or softened in certain places and put in in others, characteristic of
New England speech. Her long hair was in shining black braids that
usually hung Indian fashion over her shoulders. Large, expressive hazel
eyes, a straight nose that was Isabel’s admiration, and a sweet mouth,
gave expression to a very bright, attractive face.</p>
<p>All the girls were sensible, having no trouble over the daily program of
keeping the klondike in order, going for the water, and performing the
other small duties of common interest. Nobody was too lazy or selfish to
take her turn, or refused to do it at the proper time. The Greycliff
girls declared that Frances, Nora and Marion must all come to Greycliff
for the next school year. Isabel and Virginia Hope came over once in a
while to sputter about two or three girls in Piggly-Wiggly and on this
particular morning were sitting on the top of two wardrobe trunks in
Squirrels’ Inn.</p>
<p>“Bess Snider is a perfect baby!” Isabel was saying as she swung her
heels. “At first she was homesick. I did not blame her for that, still
when there are girls that would almost give their heads to come up here
it does seem so silly.”</p>
<p>“You can’t help homesickness, they say, Isabel.”</p>
<p>“I bet I could,—just think about something else.”</p>
<p>“That is what I did,” assented Cathalina.</p>
<p>“The next thing, Bess wanted to get out of dip and games and things and
got up headaches and pains of all sorts?”</p>
<p>“Are you sure she was pretending?”</p>
<p>“No, and I’m not telling it around, but it was awfully funny how she
could always do the things she wanted to do! But she could never take
her turn about sweeping, and we were always hanging up her bathing suit
to dry for her. If she could get anybody to do anything for her she
would. If anybody even started to the club house it was ‘O won’t you
please take this, that or the other thing for me.’ I’ve carried up her
laundry and brought her a drink of water and brought stamps for her and
mailed her letters till I’m tired of it. She is getting over some
things, but when she takes off her clothes at night she drops them right
on the floor, even her good things, and she makes us have a bad
inspection every time the camp mother comes around, unless we watch her
up.”</p>
<p>“She is just spoiled,” laughed Cathalina, with memories of a time not so
far back when she had hated to do anything for herself.</p>
<p>“There are several girls here who have maids at home,” said Isabel, “and
they don’t do that way; they think it’s fun.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to be spoiled once,” said Virginia, glowing beneath her second
layer of freckles. She dropped from the trunk, sank upon the nearest
cot, limply fell over on the pillow, and with a drawl, remarked, “Izzy,
would you mind bringing me my comb? I left it on your trunk. And Cathie,
do bring the water for me, that’s a dear. My head aches so this morning.
I think it’s a mistake about its being my turn, anyway. My, I’m hot
after games!” and Virginia fanned herself with the end of her middy tie.</p>
<p>“Pretty good imitation, Virgie,” said Isabel. “She probably wouldn’t
have played the games, though, would have had a bad ankle or arm, or a
pain somewhere.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t play yesterday,” said Betty. “I had taken cold in my
shoulder or something. Do you suppose any one thought I was lazy?”</p>
<p>“If they did, they’ll find out differently before the summer’s over,”
replied Virgie.</p>
<p>Poor little Virginia had never been “spoiled” enough, or had enough real
love in her life those last hard years on the ranch. But she had come
out of it with a tough, firm little body, and a gallant little soul with
which to meet adventures, good or ill.</p>
<p>“I am surprised at you, Margaret Virginia Hope,” said Lilian, “that you
are so hard-hearted toward Bess and condone Betty’s sins!”</p>
<p>“Please cut out the Margaret, Lilian. Don’t you remember how I told you
that I had absolutely changed my personality? Margaret and Maggie died
on the ranch.”</p>
<p>The girls recalled Virginia’s unhappy little story, confided to them, of
the handsome-looking but rough-speaking and high-tempered stepmother
whom her father had brought to the ranch, and how at last when her
father found out the state of affairs he had sent her away to school and
promised that she should not return for a time, if he could manage it.
Virginia had been afraid that she would have to go back this summer and
help, but her father’s finances improved till he found that he could
afford to send her with the girls to camp.</p>
<p>“What are you going to wear, girls, at the costume party tonight?”</p>
<p>“I’m one of the men,” said Frances. “They always have me for one because
I’m tall and have short hair. I’m going to have Cathalina’s scarlet
sport coat and other appropriate togs, a burnt cork mustache, and a
cane. We must pick our corsage bouquets this afternoon.”</p>
<p>“O, yes; you have to get one.”</p>
<p>“Yes, the gentlemen all send corsage bouquets to their ladies fair, call
for them, take them to the party and take them home again. My young lady
is ’way over at Pine Lodge, so I’ll call for her with my coach and
four.”</p>
<p>“Four feet, I suppose, yours and hers,” interpolated Virgie.</p>
<p>“Or I shall dazzle her with the headlight of my new Rolls Royce and
startle all the mosquitos and caterpillars abroad.”</p>
<p>“I remember, you just bought a big flashlight.”</p>
<p>“And gently convey her delicate form,—”</p>
<p>“May Furniss is one of the fattest girls in camp!”</p>
<p>“Why spoil my lovely tale, Isabel? Yes, May’s pretty plump and lots of
fun, and as I’m almost the tallest and skinniest, we’ll be quite a pair.
We couldn’t invite any girl in our own klondike, so I selected May.”</p>
<p>“I’m to be a man, too,” said Betty. “I’ve gathered a lot of the pretty
red wood lilies already for the bouquet.”</p>
<p>“Land, Betty, don’t you remember who you’re taking?—It’s me!” exclaimed
Virginia, somewhat ungrammatically, to be sure, but forcefully, “and
wouldn’t red lilies match my hair, though!”</p>
<p>“Sure enough,” said Betty, frowning, “but your hair isn’t—”</p>
<p>“Yes it is—sandy, anyhow. And I’m really much obliged to you, Betty, for
forgetting it. I wish I could.”</p>
<p>“Never mind, Virgie, I’ve a lot of white elder and some pretty green and
I’ll pick some buttercups and Canada lilies—you’ll be a ‘symphony’ in
white and gold. Don’t worry. Your beau’ll send you the prettiest bouquet
of the lot,” said Betty, laughing, and put her arm around the shoulder
of the little “forlorn hope” who had been so sensitive, so hungry for
love and praise, and who had worshipped at the shrine of these older
girls as much as ever Isabel, or Avalon Moore, had done. Even Marion
Thurman, who in speech and manner was as nearly the opposite of the
talkative little Westerner as could be, had taken a great fancy to both
Isabel and Virginia and enjoyed their quite frequent visits.</p>
<p>“Listen, Marion; say your name for me, please.”</p>
<p>Marion complied.</p>
<p>“There! What did I tell you, Isabel. She can say r, just doesn’t in
certain places. She gets it in Marion, but leaves it out in ‘Thuhman’.
See?”</p>
<p>“All right Virgie, you win. Say f-l-o-o-r, Marion.”</p>
<p>Goodnaturedly Marion repeated the word, for these youngsters amused her,
and secure of her Bostonian background, she it was who thought their
speech peculiar.</p>
<p>“‘Flo-uh’,” repeated Isabel. “Evelyn calls it ‘flo’. Isn’t it the most
interesting thing?”</p>
<p>“Turn about is fair play,” said Marion. “How do you pronounce
w-a-t-e-r?”</p>
<p>“Wawter,” replied Isabel promptly.</p>
<p>“Correct, go to the head. Some of the Western girls say ‘wahteh’, so
flat.”</p>
<p>“Not many of us,” said Virgie; “besides, we say wawter, not ‘wawteh’.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see the difference,” said Marion.</p>
<p>The after-dinner rest hour found some of the girls reading, some
napping, and others getting costumes ready for the evening. A few
declared that it was too much trouble to get up anything special. “I’m
just going to wear my linen camp suit,” said one of the girls in
Isabel’s klondike.</p>
<p>“We were told not to wear real party dresses, only simple summer
dresses.”</p>
<p>“O, I borrowed Marjorie’s pink georgette with lovely little flowers on
it! Marjorie wanted me to.”</p>
<p>“You may as well take it back, then, and put on one of your own frocks;
don’t you remember the head councillor said ‘no borrowing’ of good
things?”</p>
<p>Helen Paget was going as Burnt Jacket, the Indian whose wet jacket, hung
too near his camp fire on the island, had given it its name. Hilary was
to be his Indian maid. Isabel was to be a pirate, and borrowed “Mother
Nature’s” rubber boots, to be decorated with red paper.</p>
<p>“I don’t know whether Captain Kidd wore boots, or not, but I should
think he would,” said she.</p>
<p>A dangerous looking cutlass was made from a long curved stick, a
pasteboard handle attached. A cardboard knife was covered with tin foil,
which did not prove very durable when the knife was brandished in
Isabel’s most ferocious style.</p>
<p>The character taken was often chosen because of the possibilities for
the costume which each girl saw in her wardrobe. Evelyn said that she
would name her character after she got dressed. Perhaps the chief fun of
the party consisted in getting ready, and the wonder was where the girls
had managed to get so many ideas and such a variety of costumes, simple
but effective. But the party itself was a great success. The girls acted
out their parts with spirit, copied the manly walk of their brothers and
friends, used exaggerated courtesy and devotion toward their companions.</p>
<p>One of June’s little friends in Laugh-a-Lot looked especially dainty in
her light summer frock and carried a corsage bouquet of wild roses and
daisies. Her escort was a red-cheeked Spanish gentleman with a fierce
mustache and a mild expression. The gym teacher marshalled the couples
in a grand promenade in the assembly room. By pairs and fours, platoons
or circles, they marched or wound in and out. After this, they still
promenaded and several engagements took place quite publicly,
declarations, acceptance and the placing of the ring followed each other
in rapid succession. Isabel swaggered in a trifle late with a stunning
pirate bride, veil and all, and a “take her from me if you dare”
expression.</p>
<p>“If the company will get quiet,” announced the cheer leader, blowing a
whistle, “while Madame Patti (Lilian) sings ‘O Dry Those Tears’, the
distinguished Captain Kidd will be united to Miss Lucretia Borgia Vamp.”</p>
<p>With much harmless nonsense and laughter the costume party went on, but
closed quite early, for there was to be a trip to Bath the next day. As
girls whose day has been quite taken up with many interesting activities
are not loth to be “early to bed”, the flashlights danced happily toward
the different tents and cabins.</p>
<p>Everybody could go to Bath upon this first occasion. The regular morning
program, with the games, was carried out, and the girls were to come to
the noon meal ready to go to the boats. Many of them had been planning
little shopping lists.</p>
<p>“What have you to get, Flo?” asked Miss West of one of the “old girls”,
as she served those at her table to the hot dinner.</p>
<p>“I have to get a chocolate sundae and bring home a chicken sandwich,”
promptly and soberly returned that young lady, not at all understanding
why Patricia should laugh at the expression “have to get”.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you any real necessities?”</p>
<p>“O, yes; I have to buy a present for my father.”</p>
<p>“O, dear,” said Betty, who happened to be at Miss West’s table this
week, “they said we could only buy a little half-pound box of candy.”</p>
<p>“I’ve made a bet with my councillor that I’ll not touch a piece of candy
for a week. If I lose I have to give her a box of candy and if I win I
don’t get anything.”</p>
<p>“A clear conscience, Flo,” suggested Betty.</p>
<p>“That’s funny,” said another of the girls, “why wouldn’t you get
anything?”</p>
<p>“You see, I was the one that did all the betting. She wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>“Wait till I get home,—I’m going to have a regular candy eat!” This was
a pretty little girl from Laugh-a-lot, and so fat that she was almost
square. “But Mother said that was one reason she was sending me to camp,
so I wouldn’t want sodas and candy every other minute.”</p>
<p>“What are you going to buy, Marjorie?—if it’s not too inquisitive to
ask, I need to have suggestions on things I may need.” Betty pulled out
her list.</p>
<p>“A pair of hiking shoes, another pair of sneakers, besides, of course,
some candy and a sundae. Which is the best place for sundaes?”</p>
<p>“Will the girls,” came the announcement from the head table, “whose
parents want them to have shoes in Bath, please rise? I have the list,
but want to be sure that there is no mistake. What are you standing for,
Mary?”</p>
<p>“I need rubbers.”</p>
<p>“And you, Bertha?”</p>
<p>“I need rubbers, too.”</p>
<p>“Very well. But girls that need rubbers will not go with this group.
These girls will start first with Miss West, who will buy their shoes.
They will go in the Truant and leave at once with a few others that I
will send.”</p>
<p>“Going to Bath” at camp is like going “down town” or “upstreet” at home.
It is surprising how many little errands one thinks of when separated
from the shops. The weather, too, makes more difference when at camp and
dependent upon boats. But how great the advantages! How the girls all
loved the camp life, enjoying all the more the occasional trips to the
towns about. Today there was perfect weather, the river never more blue
from an almost cloudless sky. An eagle swept across above the boat. A
kingfisher dived into the water near the shore. Yellow-billed gulls
floated up and down with the movement of the waves. A little sandpiper
hurried his flight from the rocks not far away to a grassy cove. The
girls sang happily the Merrymeeting songs till all the shore dwellers
must have known who was passing. As they passed Boothbay Camp, a few of
the boys who happened to be about waved and gave the Boothbay and
Merrymaking yells.</p>
<p>Arrived at Bath, each feminine party, with some councillor, applied
itself to the delights of shopping, whether necessary or not. Patricia’s
party bought the desired hiking shoes or other covering for active feet.</p>
<p>Just before time to go to the boat, a certain time having been agreed
upon, one of the drug stores was almost full of girls, and, indeed,
councillors, having a sundae or soda before departing. Suddenly two of
the little Juniors came rushing in and up to Miss West.</p>
<p>“O, Miss West, we’ve spent all our money and have just found the
darlingest gold lockets, only five dollars and a half, and we want to
send one to our mothers. Please, Miss West! O, my daddy’ll settle for it
right away. Yes, he will. Yes, my mother will want it and I don’t want
it for myself at all. Please!”</p>
<p>The tears were very near, as the children worked themselves up to the
point that they must have the lockets and that it was mean that Miss
West would not lend them the camp money or her own. But Patricia was
firm, though kind, and succeeded in turning their attention to something
else. Cathalina, who sat at a little table near whispered to Miss West
that she would lend them the money. “O, not for the world,” she replied.
“Their parents have left money for them at the office and they can spend
only so much. Of course they have no idea of the value of money, and we
must manage for them.”</p>
<p>But it was a very well satisfied group of children that started for
Merrymeeting about four o’clock that afternoon, with their little boxes
of candy and other trifles, as well as the more important things for
which they had come.</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>One would not think that forty or fifty girls could go on a hike without
making such a noise that any well regulated bird would immediately take
to the deepest wood. Under the direction, however, of the little lady
whom the girls affectionately called “Mother Nature”, “Birdie”, or “Puss
in Boots” when she donned rubber boots, the first bird hike was quite
successful. The girls slipped quietly down the grassy road, or stood on
the rocks together, and the little Maine warblers who were out getting
their breakfast never paid a bit of attention. The big pine tree by the
side of the road was full of pine siskins, and every so often a Maryland
yellow-throat would pop up from some bush, exhibit his bright yellow
breast and black mask, and drop back again.</p>
<p>The Greycliff girls, of course, had brought their field glasses, in the
hope of discovering new birds in a different state. “Not a bit of wind
this morning, and warm,” said Hilary, “so of course the birds are out.”</p>
<p>“I don’t call this warm, this cool morning air,” returned Lilian.</p>
<p>“I mean the bright sunshine and everything. O, look!”</p>
<p>A plump little indigo bunting, shining a bright green-blue in the sun,
flew across the lane and dropped to the ground not far in front of them.</p>
<p>“Hark!” whispered Lilian. A Maryland yellow-throat was singing now, “We
<i>greet</i> you, we <i>greet</i> you, we <i>greet</i> you!” as Lilian interpreted it.</p>
<p>“He does say that,” confirmed Hilary. “It’s funny, isn’t it? They say he
says ‘wichity’, but I almost always hear him accent the song
differently. The other day I heard one say, ‘We beat you, we beat you,
Phoebe!’”</p>
<p>“Let’s go over on the rocks near those birches. I hear a lot of wood
warblers singing over there.”</p>
<p>Silently the girls climbed across rocks and bushes. It was indeed
warbler land. Hilary, who lived where the warblers often pass through
quickly in the spring migration, on account of hot days, was especially
interested. “There are a lot of redstarts,” said she. “I think that the
ones we see near our cabin, and the yellow warbler there, too, are
nesting in those bushes by us.”</p>
<p>“I wish I could see the chap that’s singing that song,” said Betty,
“Listen.”</p>
<p>“Zee, zoo, zee-zee, zoo,” hummed Lilian. “The ‘zee-zee’ is musical, a
sort of whistle, but the other notes sound like an insect, or some low
tones on a ‘cello’.”</p>
<p>“Say, Lilian, aren’t you a scientist!” said Isabel, hitching along on
the same rock.</p>
<p>“I am. I’m getting bird songs. That ‘right here’ of the chewink is new
to me. See him?”</p>
<p>“Sh-sh!” The girls stopped their low conversation as the long, sweet
notes of a white-throated sparrow began. Two or three others took up the
fairy music, while the girls sat quiet to hear it.</p>
<p>“The dears!” exclaimed Cathalina, as the song ended.</p>
<p>“Of course those crows would have to caw,” said Isabel. “I call them the
dogs of the bird world, always barking like watch dogs to tell that we
are here. Once I went into a dandy woods and the crows made such a fuss
that I didn’t see a bird.”</p>
<p>“Did you ever see anything prettier than these blueberries?” asked
Hilary. “They look like flowers growing over there on the big rocks and
between. I shall always think of grey rocks, moss, lichens and
blueberries. They match the sky and bay, don’t they? The color of the
little green plant is pretty, too. I shall never get them mixed with
huckleberries again. These taller plants are a sort of blueberry, too,
somebody said. They are dark, almost black, when they are ripe.”</p>
<p>“I think I’ve eaten a quart already. I don’t know whether to eat
blueberries or look at birds,” and Isabel put a fresh handful into her
mouth. “There is a dark berry called dog-berry, so be sure you know the
difference in the dark berries before you eat ’em when they’re ripe. I’m
not one of those that taste everything and get poisoned. Dogberries are
poisonous. But these heavenly berries!”</p>
<p>“Look, girls!” called Mother Nature, breaking the laws of silence for
once, that all might see the immense eagle which was flying over. “See
his white head and tail.”</p>
<p>The party moved on, for the hike was to cover the distance to “First
Trott’s” and back. In Merrymeeting parlance, “First Trott’s” marked a
distance of a mile and a half to where lived a family by the name Trott,
while “Second Trott’s” was located a mile further out.</p>
<p>Birches, arborvitæ trees, tall or tiny, balsams, white pines, oaks, and
other trees characteristic of the Maine woods lined the way. Back in the
shade of the pine trees grew that strange ghost flower, the Indian pipe.
Isabel counted the slender trunks in one clump of young birches and
found fifteen.</p>
<p>“I’m going to bring my camera here and take a picture of some of you
girls sitting on that wonderful big rock that slopes back above this
exquisite fern bed. These are so delicate.”</p>
<p>“New growth, I guess,” said Hilary. “But look at those across the road
now. They are more than half as tall as Isabel.”</p>
<p>“Take a leaf of this sweet fern between your fingers and squeeze it. It
is just as spicy as can be. But we’d better hurry up a little,”
continued Betty. “The rest of them are ahead of us.”</p>
<p>“Well, what is here!” exclaimed Isabel just then, stopping where on each
side of the road there was a row of immense, brown ant-hills, built up
high from the level ground. “They must be years old. See how the grass
is growing out from the top of that one, and look at the big holes
toward the bottom! I suppose those are the tunnels going back from the
openings.”</p>
<p>With interest the girls watched the busy inhabitants of this curious
apartment house. “Looks like sawdust on top,” said one.</p>
<p>Along the more shady portions of the pretty, winding road few birds were
seen. All seemed to be out where sunshine lit up their dining rooms.
Occasionally a squirrel or chipmunk scolded them roundly, as the girls
passed too near their place of abode. As they returned to camp, Hilary
and Lilian lingered in the rear. “It was right here in these bushes,”
Hilary was saying. “I did not get a good look at it all over, but I hope
and think that it is a black-billed cuckoo, for I so seldom see one,
that is, to be sure of it. Let’s creep up real softly and maybe we’ll
see it. I think it stays around here.”</p>
<p>The cuckoo proved to be a very accommodating bird, for when they reached
the neighborhood of the bushes, out it flew from one near them,
retreating to one which was farther off, but had so much less foliage
that the heavy bird was easily seen.</p>
<p>“It is!” whispered Hilary. “It lifted its head and I saw every bit of
its bill. And when it flew there was no sign of black in its tail.”</p>
<p>“That will be another point for you, Hilary.”</p>
<p>“But you identified it, too.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but you saw it yesterday and thought it was the blackbilled.”</p>
<p>“All right. Maybe some other girl has seen it, though, and reported on
it first.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe so. I got the black and white creeping warbler first
while we were all at the rocks, you know, and I saw the least flycatcher
first too,—two points for me on birds so far.”</p>
<p>“Somebody reported the tree swallow this morning before I had a chance
to, but I found its nest in the knot of that apple tree near the club
house. Come on and I’ll show you. Isn’t it pathetic that those poor
kingbirds have to watch their nest so, or think they have to?”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you notice the kingbird’s nest on the very end of the tree next
to the klondike opposite us? There is a white string hanging down from
it. You’ll only have to look that way to see it. I suppose they never
dreamed that all this crowd of girls would come, when they built the
nest.”</p>
<p>“Most of the birds are so hard to see. The foliage is so thick, and then
they are nesting, too, and that makes them shy.”</p>
<p>“Been on the hike?” asked Nora, as the girls reached the cabin. “I
couldn’t wake up enough. It’s inhuman to expect anybody to get up before
six o’clock.”</p>
<p>“It was fine. Better go the next time, Pat,” said Frances.</p>
<p>Later Lilian found that her little “zee, zoo” bird was a black-throated
green warbler, and saw some baby ones in the bushes near the pine grove.
Hilary soon had quite a list of warblers that nested about Merrymeeting.
The gulls, chiefly the Herring Gull, came in numbers every day to be
fed. A Laughing Gull was seen near Bath, and a Ring-Billed Gull near the
boys’ island. On the Wiscasset trip much later, a fish hawk’s nest was
seen on one of the piles common in the river. To the great amusement of
the party one little city girl asked “How do the fishes get up there?”</p>
<p>After the birds had been duly studied, and the bright colored pictures
put up in the club house as each bird was reported, the attention of the
girls was turned to the wild flowers, of which there were so many. At
first five flowers brought to the nature teacher gave one point.
Finally, when the common flowers had all been reported, one of the rarer
flowers made a point for its discoverer. Some funny mistakes were made,
and no wonder, for why is not “pussy-foot” clover just as good a name as
rabbit’s-foot clover, or “scrambled eggs” as good as butter and eggs?
And what is the difference between “church steeple” and steeple bush?</p>
<p>It was Cathalina who showed the members of the Greycliff nature club the
wintergreen with its waxen berries and the trailing arbutus plants along
the lane.</p>
<p>“Are you sure it’s wintergreen?” inquired the cautious Isabel before
tasting the young leaves, as Cathalina invited her to do.</p>
<p>“Yes, it tastes just like wintergreen candy, or tooth paste!”</p>
<p>During the season, odd and beautiful bouquets adorned the tables at
meals. Indian pipe standing high in a bit of greenery; Canadian lilies,
wood lilies, meadow sweet, steeple bush, bunch berries, milk wort,
Indian paintbrush, buttercups or daisies, fall dandelions in prickly
juniper, wild roses as late as August, or the stately cardinal
flower,—all these by turns found their way into the vases and bowls.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER VIII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>CANOE TESTS AND A CAMP FIRE</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>Eloise in her red and black bathing suit and scarlet cap was a striking
little figure. Lithe and active, she selected her paddle and flew down
to the dock to select her canoe, for the canoe tests were in progress.
“Wish me good luck, girls,” said she as she pushed out her canoe from
the sands and jumped in it.</p>
<p>Out beyond the dock and floats, toward the back water, a blue canoe,
bottom up, was being steadily pushed to shore by some swimmer, whose
bobbing head showed behind it. One girl had brought in her canoe, pushed
its nose into the sand, and while drawing herself into a reclining
position upon it declared that she was going to take a nap then and
there. Another had gone out where the current was almost too strong for
her and was having difficulty to manage a canoe that apparently wanted
to go down the Kennebec and out to sea. She was making slight headway,
while from the guarding rowboat came an occasional word of
encouragement.</p>
<p>“I can’t do it,” she said at last. “I could swim it, but I can’t take
the canoe in.” The rowboat approached and a dripping figure climbed over
its side. Both girl and canoe were brought to the dock. It was
Cathalina, her face solemn with disappointment.</p>
<p>“Better luck next time, Cathalina,” said Betty, who was almost as
disappointed as Cathalina, but would not show it.</p>
<p>“I’ll wait till tomorrow before I try it again. Isn’t it horrid? I wish
I were a regular Samson!”</p>
<p>“You’ll do it all right the next time. I don’t believe I could have done
it either if I had been where you were. Go out toward the back water
tomorrow. Here comes Lil. Good work, Lilian.”</p>
<p>Betty had been successful in her canoe test, and while waiting for the
other girls, was swimming or playing around in shallow water.</p>
<p>“Watch Eloise. There she is, just ready to tip over.” Like a scarlet
tanager in black and red, Eloise stood poised in her boat, handing her
paddle to her guardian of the row boat, and waiting till the row boat
drew off.</p>
<p>“There she goes!” Betty and Cathalina stood in the water watching, and
Lilian paused in drawing in her boat to see Eloise perform her
spectacular act, now on the edge of her canoe, tipping it, now going
over and down, coming up in a jiffy and turning her canoe shoreward.</p>
<p>“Rowing is so much harder work than paddling,” said Cathalina. “I’m glad
that I’m learning canoeing, but I wish I were more at home in the
water.”</p>
<p>“The only way is to do it a lot, I guess,” said Betty. “Let’s do as much
paddling as we can up here and go in for the races at school next year.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe Mother and Father would let me race,” said Cathalina.</p>
<p>“O, they never get up much speed at Greycliff.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, I’m going to paddle all I can. Will you go out with me this
afternoon if they let us?”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed.”</p>
<p>Wet and smiling, Eloise brought in her canoe. “Do you think I made it,
girls?”</p>
<p>“Of course you made it!” cried the generous Cathalina. “I hope I do
tomorrow if they have ’em again. If not, some other day. Where’s Hilary,
by the way?”</p>
<p>“She and Helen are together somewhere. They said they were coming down
for the tests, but must have forgotten it. They passed theirs the other
day, you know.”</p>
<p>“O, Cathalina—Cathalina Van Buskirk!” called one of the councillors. The
girls ran to get their bath robes and bathing caps, which were draped
over the railing at the dock.</p>
<p>“Miss Allen is still sick today; why can’t you take her French class?
They can’t afford to lose the time.”</p>
<p>“Why,—I never taught anything in my life.”</p>
<p>“But you have had plenty of private teaching, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes; shall I do it that way?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. Anybody that can talk French as you can ought to be able to
take these little girls through a couple of lessons. Give them some easy
conversation and take them over the ground they ought to cover in the
reader. If you feel like hearing them recite their verbs, all the
better.”</p>
<p>Cathalina’s discouragement over not passing the canoe test was gone and
she hurried into her clothes, planning happily just what sort of a
conversation she would conduct, delighted to be a good camper and help
in something she knew about, if she couldn’t bring in that canoe! “But
I’ll do it tomorrow, Hilary,” she told Hilary that night in recounting
the day’s exploits, “see if I don’t!” And Cathalina did.</p>
<p>That afternoon there was a hare and hounds chase. During rest hour some
of the girls tore paper into pieces, to be dropped here and there for
the trail. One of the councillors led the hares, who were to have a good
start before the hounds, in charge of another councillor or two, should
take up the chase. By the time the chase was ended there were few of the
girls who did not know the ins and outs of the pine grove, the rocks,
the meadows, the lane, and the trail along the back water.</p>
<p>Of the Greycliff girls, Hilary, Lilian and Virginia were among the
hounds, that started after a certain definite time had elapsed.
Everybody was talking at once and excitement was growing. As they knew
that the start was to be made through the pine grove, the line of hounds
headed that way from the club house.</p>
<p>“Here’s the first paper!” shouted Virgie. “Come on! Bow-wow!”</p>
<p>Through the bushes, over the roots and rocks, slipping through the
birches in what Hilary called Warblerville, they hurried. It was there
that a dainty little redstart sat on the edge of a tiny nest to greet
them the first day they wandered about Merrymeeting.</p>
<p>“Mercy! Do I have to climb that rock?” said one of the little girls.</p>
<p>“Over you go,” and with two or three helping hands to boost, up she
went, to slide down on the other side.</p>
<p>“Here’s a clear trail,” cried Frances, and the running hounds followed
to the middle of a big meadow, only to find that the trail ended there
and to return to the place where they had entered the field.</p>
<p>“Hilary, you go that way, Lilian that, and I’ll go this way,” called
Frances, “and see if we can find the trail more quickly.” Lilian found
it and beckoned to the rest. At the edge of a ravine they paused.</p>
<p>“I bet they never ran down there,” said Virgie. “They’d have to get
right out again; let’s go around and pick up the trail.” But her plan
was overruled. The whole party climbed or slid down, only to find that
Virgie’s surmise was correct and that the hares had probably let one or
two of their number fix this blind trail, while the rest of them went on
to drop the paper in another direction.</p>
<p>Further on, in a bit of woods, the trail led them in a circle, where
again the hounds lost time. Not once did they catch a glimpse of the
hares and arrived at camp headquarters to find that they had been in for
some time.</p>
<p>“That old engine sounds good to me,” said Virginia, for the water was
being pumped from the drilled well and pails of clear, cold water
carried down to the dining-room for supper.</p>
<p>Hilary and Lilian were repairing damages and washing dusty faces and
hands when Eloise; who had been a hare, came to borrow Betty’s Indian
blanket. “I’ll take good care of it, Betty,” she said. “How do I look in
it?”—draping it around her shoulders.</p>
<p>“What is up?” asked Hilary.</p>
<p>“Our klondike gives the camp fire tonight and we are going to be
Indians. Don’t miss it. Helen’s father sent boxes of the most delicious
marshmallows you ever ate. Wasn’t it nice of him?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you want my steamer rug?” inquired Cathalina.</p>
<p>“I think not. If anybody needs one I’ll send her over; thank you,
Cathie. May has a duck of a blanket, just a cotton one, such as they
make bath robes of, and it is so gay and pretty.”</p>
<p>“I suppose the camp fire will be on Marshmallow Point?”</p>
<p>“Yes; a real ‘Injun’ camp fire, where the Indians used to have them.”</p>
<p>As the girls came down to the point upon the ringing of the bell after
supper, a tall, stolid “Indian” met them and waved them to the lower
rocks. Behind other rocks Indian head-dresses showed. Presently there
appeared a group of dignified Indians, much painted, wearing feathers of
a remarkable variety and draped in blankets or what made one think of
that civilized garment known as the bath robe. While they posed, one of
the girls from Pine Lodge read an account of the early days upon the
Kennebec and Merrymeeting Bay when the point was a trading resort and
place of meeting for the Indians.</p>
<p>“From the lodges along the Kennebec and from the camp fires of the
Androscoggin they have come to make plans for peace upon Merrymeeting
Bay. A captive maid is to be returned to the Kennebec lover from whom
she was stolen and the wicked kidnapper, of another tribe, is to be
sentenced to exile. Behold the council fire!”</p>
<p>Softly from behind the rocks, in the posed Indian moccasins, other
figures joined the first group and with them marched in silent
procession before the spectators. Then they circled round the camp fire,
which was then lit by the chieftain.</p>
<p>After this interesting part of the ceremony had been watched by the
audience (though not in silence, for the chief had some difficulty in
getting his fire to burn), the other Indians lit their torches
(flash-lights) from the camp fire and started a weird dance upon the
rocks to the sound of an Indian drum beating in hollow tones. Presently
the dance stopped and the Indians sat down in a circle around the chief.</p>
<p>“Bring forth the captive!” called the chief in a sepulchral voice. Then
came an Indian maid, well hung with beads, her hands bound, her head
bowed, as she walked between two Indian guards. While she knelt before
the chief, Lilian’s voice came from the rocks in “From the Land of the
Sky-Blue Water”. Like her prototype in the song, the “captive maid was
mute”, though she told the girls afterward that she longed to break her
bonds, for a bug was crawling up her arm and a mosquito had just bitten
her nose.</p>
<p>The girls played well their short Indian drama. The bonds of the captive
maid were loosened and she was restored to the arms of her Indian lover,
who glared dramatically at his rival, the captive villain who was
sentenced to exile and slunk away to his canoe, as pointed out by the
old chief:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The play over at this point, the attractive Indians now brought out the
boxes of marshmallows and passed them around to the assembled company
who had previously provided themselves with sticks. Afterward came the
usual singing of the dear Merrymeeting songs and other favorites; and
while Lilian’s voice, never sweeter, floated softly in “By the Waters of
Minnetonka,” the waters of the Kennebec rippled past, and the same old
moon which had looked upon the real Indians not so many years ago, shone
down on the blithe Merrymeeting campers.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
<h2 id='chIX' title='IX: CHURCH AND A SUNDAY MOON'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER IX</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>CHURCH AND A SUNDAY MOON</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>It was a glorious Sabbath morning. The waters rippled and sparkled as
the tide came hurrying in early; but there was no bell for dip on Sunday
morning and breakfast was put at a later hour. The girls had been asked
to come to breakfast prepared to leave on the launches for church.</p>
<p>“Where do we go to church, Frances?” Hilary asked.</p>
<p>“Sometimes to one of the little churches up the river, but often to
Bath, for there we can choose churches of different denominations, go to
our own or visit others.”</p>
<p>Two boat loads started. Aeolus and Truant chugged their way down stream,
through the Burnt Jackets and past Boothbay Camp, where a few boys waved
and cheered; past Brushwood Lodge, quiet and lovely in its rocks and
greenery; past happily sailing gulls and shores of solid rock and
evergreens; past the little hamlet of West Woolwich, on down the river
to the now familiar little town of Bath.</p>
<p>Hilary, Lilian and Cathalina looked closely at the island as they passed
Boothbay Camp, to see if there were any signs of Campbell.</p>
<p>“I think that the church folks have already left, since there seemed to
be so few boys around,” said Cathalina in a low tone to Hilary. “The
question is, will he go to your church, hoping to see you, or to his own
church, and where will you go?”</p>
<p>Hilary colored a little and replied, “I should love to see Campbell, but
I think that I shall go with you girls today, as I should plan to do in
any case. Probably he can’t choose, but will have to take some group of
boys.”</p>
<p>“That is so,” replied Cathalina, who was deeply concerned in her cousin
Campbell’s interest in Hilary ever since he had first met her on her
visit to Cathalina. And now that Philip had been impressed with Lilian,
Cathalina felt that she was living in an atmosphere of the highest
romance. Confidences from all quarters were hers. Lilian had looked as
conscious as Hilary while passing the island, for Philip might come at
any time.</p>
<p>Campbell Stuart, meanwhile, trusted to no chance meeting. So far his
responsibilities and labors in the early days of camp had prevented him
from calling at Merrymeeting to see his cousin and her friends. But here
he was at the dock as the Aeolus floated in, his blue eyes lit up with
pleasure and his lips parted in smiles, as he lifted his hat to Hilary,
Cathalina, and the boat load in general. And now he was helping the
girls off and walked between Hilary and Cathalina, while Lilian and
Betty fell in behind.</p>
<p>“How’d you get off, Campbell?” asked Cathalina.</p>
<p>“I just told the ‘boss’ that I had a cousin and some friends at
Merrymeeting whom I had not yet had a chance to see, and asked if I
might not wait to walk with you all to church. Having confidence in me,
he said I might. So here we are,” he concluded, looking down at Hilary’s
demure countenance.</p>
<p>The walk was all too short for all that there was to say, and at the
church Campbell joined the masculine crew from Boothbay, which sat
quietly under the observing eyes of the different councillors. After the
service, however, the girls saw him for a few moments.</p>
<p>“I’m going to paddle up some time soon, and shall bring Phil up, of
course, as soon as he finds he can come. If I don’t come, you’ll know
it’s because I can’t help it, and I’ll be there with bells on at the
annual picnic. You be sure, girls, to come to our picnic at Boothbay,
won’t you?” Though Campbell addressed all, he looked at Hilary, who
replied, “Indeed we wouldn’t miss it for the world!” and Cathalina
added, “So say we all!”</p>
<p>“How much of that sermon did you hear, Hilary?” asked Cathalina
teasingly, as they climbed into the boat for the ride back to camp.</p>
<p>“Lots of it,” said Hilary. “Don’t think you can tease me so much, Miss
Cathalina Van Buskirk. It was a good sermon, too, and made me think of
Father in his pulpit preaching away and looking like a saint, as he
is,—and Mother sitting in the pew so sweet and nice, and the boys, and
little Mary. But I wasn’t homesick, some way, just happy.”</p>
<p>“You’re a dear,” said Cathalina affectionately. “You are our pretty,
sweet old Hilary so you are, and shan’t be teased. No wonder
Campbell,—well, here I go again! Excuse me.”</p>
<p>“You are quite forgiven, Cathie. I don’t mind, only not much before the
other girls, please.”</p>
<p>“Honestly, Hilary, and no nonsense, hasn’t Campbell grown up in these
two years?”</p>
<p>“Yes he and Phil are both so different, I mean in the way of being young
men and not just boys. Just think, it will be two years next Christmas
since I was at your house! What fun we had! It was the nicest visit I
ever had anywhere.”</p>
<p>“We must have more of them. It isn’t my fault that we haven’t already.”</p>
<p>“O, I know, Cathalina, but I have not been able to manage it. You have
invited me often enough.”</p>
<p>“I hope to take Lilian home with me from here.”</p>
<p>“That will be lovely. Have you asked her yet?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and she has written home about it. Phil wants to have a fraternity
brother, and with the cousins, we shall have quite a party. If you only
could come!—even for just over the week end would be something. School
begins a little later than usual this year.”</p>
<p>“That will give a little over two weeks at home,—unless we left camp a
little earlier. But we couldn’t miss the big banquet and all the fun.”</p>
<p>“My, no!”</p>
<p>“Mother wrote that she wanted to see the camp, and I believe that we can
arrange it. Phil can do the driving, so we won’t need the chauffeur,
unless Mother wants to have him. She can fix it all up as usual. Anyway
there is plenty of room for us all. It will be a pretty trip, Hilary,
and we’d stop a day or two in Boston and see Cambridge and Lexington and
Concord, you know.”</p>
<p>“O, wonderful! I have been thinking that I’d write to ask Father if I
might not take that trip home with the camp folks. June can go back with
the crowd.”</p>
<p>“Don’t do it; go back with us instead. You haven’t been in New York in
the summer. And if possible, I want Betty to go, too. Isn’t it funny and
nice how plans grow? I thought of Lilian first on account of Phil, then
you on account of Campbell, and of all of you on my own account.”</p>
<p>“This is the most wonderful world anyway. I never dreamed of having such
good times before I went to Greycliff.”</p>
<p>As Isabel and Virginia Hope sat at the same table this week with Hilary,
she had to answer their questions as they all ate chickens and dressing
for their Sunday dinner.</p>
<p>“Who was that perfectly wonderful looking councillor that was with you
girls this morning?” asked Isabel.</p>
<p>Hilary gave the same reply that she had already given several times
before dinner: “That is Cathalina’s cousin, Campbell Stuart.”</p>
<p>“Had you ever met him before?”</p>
<p>“Yes, when I visited Cathalina, almost two years ago. I met a number of
her cousins and know them very well.” This in an effort to forestall any
comments about possible attentions to her on Campbell’s part.</p>
<p>“He looks a little like Cathalina. Isn’t he tall and skinny, though?”</p>
<p>“I should say that Campbell is very well built for a young man.”</p>
<p>“He certainly is. Virgie, do you suppose that we’ll ever have any one as
nice to take us around? If he comes up to see you girls, you’ll
introduce him to us, won’t you?”</p>
<p>“I most certainly will,” laughed Hilary. “I think that Cathalina will be
very proud of both her brother and her cousin and will want all her
friends to meet them.”</p>
<p>“Hm-m,” said Isabel. “Smart old Hilary. Item for the ‘Moon’. Mr.
Campbell Stuart, councillor at Boothbay Camp and cousin of Cathalina Van
Buskirk, met Cathalina at the dock this morning and walked to church
with her and her friends. Nobody but Cathalina was glad to see him.’”</p>
<p>“Seems to me,” replied Hilary with a twinkle, “that a lot of interest is
developing right here about Mr. Stuart. I’ll have to tell him.”</p>
<p>“If you do!” threatened Isabel. “By the way, why is the camp paper
called the <i>Moon</i>?”</p>
<p>“Because it comes out at night.”</p>
<p>“Honest?”</p>
<p>“Yes, really. Frances said so.”</p>
<p>“Well how does it happen that you, a preacher’s daughter, are an editor
on a Sunday paper?”</p>
<p>“In the first place, it is not a ‘Sunday paper’, except that it is read
on Sunday evening; then it isn’t work, just fun, and gives us something
to do. We were nearly upset last night by one of the contributions that
was handed in just before bedtime. Patty had to call us down twice for
giggling after we were in bed. It was the funniest thing!”</p>
<p>“I think that Frances will make a good editor, assistant editor, I mean.
She knows everything about camp, and with your bunch right at hand to
write poetry and all kinds of things, her part in the paper ought to go.
I’m a reporter myself!”</p>
<p>“Remember that all your news will be censored, particularly that item
about Campbell.”</p>
<p>After dinner the girls strolled to their cabins for rest hour.</p>
<p>“Wake me up, Hilary,” said Lilian, “in time to write my letter home and
finish my verses for the <i>Moon</i>. Chicken and dressing and gravy and
blueberry pie and things are too much for me, and I must have a nap.”</p>
<p>“All right. I’m not sleepy. I’m going to read, for I have my letter home
written, except adding a little about church. We have enough for the
Moon already in, and all there is left to do is to pin any more
contributions on the pages of the magazine where they belong. Frances is
using an old <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> and divided it off into the
different departments yesterday, leaving vacant pages for later
contributions.”</p>
<p>“I just wrote home yesterday, but I suppose I’ll have to write to
somebody as a ticket of admission to supper. I might write to Phil,” she
added, mischievously glancing at Lilian, “and tell him that Lilian has
succumbed to chicken and pie.”</p>
<p>Lilian opened a sleepy eye. “Don’t, Cathalina. It’s so delicious to feel
sleepy and if you start fun going I’ll get waked up. There comes our
councillor. Now you will have to be quiet, at least during rest hour.”</p>
<p>“Not a soul shall disturb your slumbers,” declared Hilary, and Lilian
tucked one little hand under her cheek, turned over on her cot, and was
asleep in a jiffy.</p>
<p>When the bell rang that evening after supper at about half past seven,
it summoned the camp family to the Sunday evening gathering at the club
house. Little girls, big girls and many of the councillors sat upon the
floor to listen to the reading of the weekly chronicle of camp life,
known as the <i>Moon</i>. Chairs around the wall or at one end held the rest
of the family, and the doctor, swimming instructor, and other gentlemen
whose oversight and assistance were quite necessary to camp comfort and
success, usually dropped in to hear the paper read.</p>
<p>There was little that this literary journal would not attempt. Stories,
short or continued, articles, editorials, society news, personals,
poetry and even an amusing department of questions and answers conducted
by one “Mrs. O’Brien”. Question and answer were usually written by the
same contributor or editor, but that, it is said, is sometimes done in
other periodicals. There were some interesting editorials, one
expressing welcome to all the campers and particularly to all the new
girls and councillors. Another defined a “good sport” and gave some of
the wholesome camp ideas on helpfulness, unselfishness, and camp spirit.
Reports were given on athletics, with the names of the team captains,
and the general program of activities was outlined.</p>
<p>Klondike life and conversation were the subject of a few clever
sketches. In verse appeared the story of the caterpillars which had
invaded cabins, and even cots—whether alone or assisted is uncertain—in
the early days of camp. Dire pictures were drawn of fuzzy travelers that
descended from ceilings and climbed the bridges of noses. Poetic
exaggeration also made much of attacks from a mosquito army, under
captains, majors, and lieutenants who were undaunted by the taste of
insectolatum, citronella, or pennyroyal.</p>
<p>Anything in praise of camp was welcome to the loyal girls, as well as
the bright little personals which brought them into kindly or joking
notice.</p>
<p>From the junior cabin came a short story by June, which was entitled
“Lost or Kidnapped?—A True Story.”</p>
<p>“This is the story of a junior at Merrymeeting Camp and her adventure.
She was a very pretty little girl. Everybody liked her, but she had one
fault which shall be seen.</p>
<p>“One day the girls went on a hike to First Trott’s. They had a very good
time. They ate blueberries, picked flowers in the woods and brought home
plenty of Indian pipe for table bouquets. They did not touch them for
fear they would turn black, as they have a way of doing.</p>
<p>“All the girls were laughing and talking and having great fun on the way
home. When the supper bell rang, everybody went to the dining hall as
usual. But when the girls at Mother Nature’s table sat down, Dot was not
there. Mother Nature told the head councillor and her face turned white,
because Dot is not very old and something might have happened to her.</p>
<p>“So they slipped around and asked the juniors and some of the other
girls where they had seen Dot last. Jo remembered seeing her when they
were about half way home, but nobody knew where she was. It seemed very
serious. Somebody started out at once on the little road. Somebody else
went to the pine grove, and several girls began to look all over camp
for her. Jo happened to think of looking in the cabin. And there was
Dot, reading a book! She hadn’t even heard the supper bell!</p>
<p>“Her carelessness had made a great deal of trouble for everybody, but
nobody had gotten so far away that they were not easily called back. And
everybody was so glad that it had turned out all right that Dot did not
even get a scolding.”</p>
<p>Lilian had had some trouble with her verses. She was undecided whether
to have a fair, round, full or high moon, and spent some time in getting
a rhyme for “reflection”. Then she hit upon “direction”, and in thinking
of the somewhat devious way which the Kennebec followed “indirection”
occurred to her. This at once finished her last lines, and as the
subject was appropriate to an evening edition, they were used to close
the “Moon”.</p>

<p>The evening ended with the singing of the old hymns or of more modern
sacred songs. One councillor played the accompaniments; another led the
singing and announced the selections. Favorite hymns were called for.
The girls could remain or retire to their cabins, but many stayed and
enjoyed this fitting close to the Sabbath.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER X</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>A “STUNT NIGHT”</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>“On the ringing of the bell,” came the announcement at supper, “each
klondike must present a ‘stunt’ at the club house. Twenty minutes now to
get up the performance. See who will have the best.” The smiling face of
the head councillor indicated her confidence in her girls. She knew that
they had plenty of interesting ideas in their heads and expected a good
entertainment.</p>
<p>“Mercy,” said Virgie, “I couldn’t think up anything in twenty minutes,
let alone get it ready!”</p>
<p>“O, yes we can,” said Isabel, “come on. Some of the old girls will know
what they do here.”</p>
<p>There was hurrying and scurrying to klondikes and much laughter with the
thinking and planning. “Suppose we think up the same thing some other
klondike does,” suggested Marion, as she walked from supper with
Frances. “O, we never do; don’t worry,” Frances replied.</p>
<p>Patty West had been transferred to Squirrels’ Inn in some shifting of
councillors, and to her the girls of that klondike rushed. Patty was
already racking her brains, she asserted, but so far nothing had
occurred to her.</p>
<p>“I tell you what I have, Miss Patty,” said Cathalina, “something that
Ann Maria said the girls at her school acted out one time and Mother was
so amused, for she and her cousins used to do it,—I think it came out in
the <i>St. Nicholas</i> or something when she was a girl, or maybe she found
it in the old magazines at home. Anyway it is just an old poem called
‘The Ballad of Mary Jane’. Of course, we can’t learn it, but one of us
can read it and the rest can take the parts and act it out, in
pantomime.”</p>
<p>A brief rehearsal with a quick assembling of costumes and other
necessary articles was all that was possible. Miss West was to do the
reading, while Cathalina, who was familiar with the poem, was to be
stage director, send on the actors at the proper time, cause the
pasteboard sun to rise, and do the various duties connected with her
position. Other klondikes were in the same state of interesting hurry.
Fortunately the ringing of the bell was delayed a little, but by twenty
minutes of eight, rows of big and little girls, the little ones in
front, sat facing the “stage” of the club house. This was the little
room or den at one end of the assembly room. Its walls extended only a
short way, to indicate division of a sort, and a curtain could be drawn
across if desired. Curtains were usually made from two sheets or two big
blankets hastily hemmed to permit a rope to be drawn through, the rope
then fastened to hooks or nails.</p>
<p>The audience was composed of those who did not take part in the actual
performance presented by their group, or who would not be called on for
some time. Clapping of hands indicated some impatience.</p>
<p>“Lights out!” called some one, and the switch for the main room was
turned off. As the lights in the little room had not been turned on, all
was in total darkness. Flashlights began to be turned on and brought a
protest from the stage.</p>
<p>“Turn off your flashes! Don’t you know we hadn’t time to put up a
curtain, and have to fix the stage? Please, girls.” These were the
little folks from Laugh-a-lot and Little Content whose “stunt” came
first.</p>
<p>Presently the stage lights came on disclosing a small child washing
dishes, the dishpan on a chair, while June, dressed in a long skirt,
with a scarf pinned around her shoulders and her hair done up high, was
preparing a basket.</p>
<p>“Now, little Red Riding-Hood, get your cloak and let me put it on for
you. Here, my child, are some nice fruit and a fresh blueberry pie for
your grandmother. Go straight there and don’t stop to talk to any one on
the way!” June’s finger was raised impressively.</p>
<p>“All right, Mother,” replied Red Riding-Hood in her most sugary tones,
while the audience laughed. The mother fastened the red cape and hood
that made somebody’s little rain coat, kissed her little girl, waved her
hand to her as Red Riding-Hood set out, and followed her to the door
where she stood, still waving. Then she returned to her rocking chair,
picked up some knitting, and settled back with a great air of
responsibility. Promptly the lights went out again and a few adjustments
were made for the next scene.</p>
<p>When the lights went on the signs of housekeeping had been removed. A
placard placed upon the table announced “The Woods”. Little Red
Riding-Hood came strolling in, swinging her basket and looking at the
birds. “O, aren’t you pretty? I guess you’re a song sparrow. O, what’s
that?”</p>
<p>From the right of the stage came suddenly a terrible looking animal
whose tawny coat looked much like one of the girls’ ponchos.</p>
<p>“Gr-rr-rr! Where are you going, little girl? Don’t be afraid, I won’t
hurt you.”</p>
<p>“O, I’m just going to take some fruit to my grandmother.”</p>
<p>“Where does your grandmother live?”</p>
<p>“Just in a nice little house on the edge of the wood.”</p>
<p>The rest of the story proceeded in due order, the children making up the
lines as they went along, all of them, of course, being perfectly
familiar with the story. The wolf duly found the grandmother in bed and
ate her up with much scuffling and growling, putting on her cap and
getting into her bed, a pallet on the floor. How innocently did little
Red Riding-Hood ask, “What makes your teeth so long and sharp,
Grandmother?” And how fiercely did the wolf reply, “All the better
to-eat-you-all-up-with!” The scene and drama ended with the timely
coming of the woodcutters and the demise of the snarling wolf.</p>
<p>Loud applause greeted the little folks who had thoroughly enjoyed
playing the parts and were pleased that the girls liked their efforts.
Hilary watching June, whispered to Lilian that she felt like hugging the
child. “She looks and acts so like Mother!”</p>
<p>Squirrels’ Inn then put on The Ballad of Mary Jane in pantomime. Hilary
as Mary Jane looked the prim school teacher in long dress, stiff shirt
waist, high collar. Her hair was in a tight knot. She entered carrying a
bag of school books, reading a small volume and passed and repassed at
the front of the stage to show how “To teach the village school she
walked each morning down the lane,” this maid who “could manufacture
griddle-cakes and jest in ancient Greek.”</p>
<p>Frances Anderson was the “stalwart Benjamin”, who leaned on his hoe with
open mouth and saw “the beauteous maiden pass at breaking of the dawn”.
Little did he look like the future pirate who was to burst in and rescue
Mary Jane, from her cruel father (Nora) with the “fatal knife”, and his
rival, Lord Mortimer (Betty). Lilian, attired in the same poncho in
which the wolf had appeared, and wearing paper horns, represented the
cow from which Mary Jane dramatically rescued Benjamin by means of her
umbrella.</p>
<p>A fashion show came next, requiring little stage setting but much
dressing. This was given by one of the senior klondikes and was very
pretty. Mrs. Astorbilt was first announced and entered in evening gown.
She was followed by the sport girl, the business girl, and others for
whom costumes could be prepared upon short notice, the Merrymeeting girl
closing the parade, and wearing the full costume, with headband,
armband, and a diamond upon her sweater. She carried a big volley ball
under her arm and held up to view the Merrymeeting trophy cup. All the
girls had looked so pretty that each had received hearty applause; but
the Merrymeeting girl appealed to camp loyalty and was cheered
vociferously with “rah, rah, Merrymeeting!”</p>
<p>An alphabetical romance was given by another cabin. In this the lines
were of the alphabet alone, repeated with varying expression, occasional
well known abbreviations, as q. e. d., i. e., or U. S. A., included.</p>
<p>The last stunt was called “Five Minutes in Laugh-a-lot.” Great curiosity
was evident among the audience as in the darkness they could dimly see a
figure arranged on the table and covered with something white. “Elaine?”
“Operating room?” were suggested, but the stage director ordered silence
and the lights were not turned on.</p>
<p>Dim figures stole in with flashlights. “Bz-zz-zz! Bz-zz-zz! Bz-zz-zz!”
they sang, moving arms for wings and tiptoeing an insect dance around
the table. It was now evident that this was a cot in Laugh-a-lot, the
sleeper covered with mosquito netting which was merely a bit of
suggestive stage property, having no foundation in fact. The mosquitos
hovered around and now and then one would make a dive in her direction.
Then hands would wave widly and the netting fail of its purpose. All
this because little Dorothy Freneau’s plump cheeks had exhibited several
mosquito bites for a day or two.</p>
<p>Presently the mosquitos joined hands, danced to the front and sang
softly a mosquito song, written by the councillor under pressure in
about five minutes. At its close they went out still buzzing, while some
one from behind the table raised a large flashlight to indicate the
coming of the sun. This was the farewell song:</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>“We want six more for the war canoe,” shouted the swimming teacher from
the stern of that long, graceful, dark blue vessel.</p>
<p>“Come on, Miss West.”</p>
<p>“Throw me a life preserver to sit on,—please—we’re going three in this
canoe.”</p>
<p>“You and I, Frances,” said Marion.</p>
<p>“No, you and I, Marion,” firmly insisted another girl, both Frances and
Marion yielding to avoid controversy.</p>
<p>“Four more for the war canoe,” from the megaphone again.</p>
<p>“All right, Betty,” said Hilary, “you and Cathalina go on in the war
canoe,—they need more and it will be easier for you, I believe. Lil and
I will take this one by ourselves. Do you want to paddle bow or stern,
Lil?”</p>
<p>“I don’t care, Hilary.”</p>
<p>“You’re not quite so husky as I am, and stern will be hard for you if
you aren’t used to it. I guess you’d better paddle bow.”</p>
<p>“Not for that reason, Hilary. Why should you take the hardest place?”</p>
<p>A good-natured squabble followed, in which Hilary won, settled Lilian in
the bow and pushed the canoe out from the sands, jumping in at the
stern. “I’ve got that dandy stroke that Mr. Clark showed me. It keeps
the canoe going straight forward and you rest your paddle just a second
on the edge, so it’s easier.” As Hilary spoke she gave the shore a final
push with her paddle, and sent the canoe gliding smoothly into the
deeper water.</p>
<p>“O, isn’t this fun? I just adore canoeing!”</p>
<p>“Adoration, exclamation, consummation,” murmured Lilian.</p>
<p>“Hesitation, coronation,—there are about a hundred of ’em if you are
wanting a rhyme.”</p>
<p>One by one the pretty canoes were selected and launched. At first there
was apparent confusion as the girls flitted hither and thither, choosing
paddles and partners under the general oversight of the athletic
director and swimming teacher, but at last the fleet was ready to
depart.</p>
<p>The occasion was a picnic at Swan’s Island, a large island in
Merrymeeting Bay. As this was the first real canoe trip of any length,
only the good paddlers and swimmers were permitted to take out the
canoes. The rest went in the Aeolus and Truant, while the Midget with a
few passengers carried the lunch. Up to this time there had been
instruction, and paddling within certain limits.</p>
<p>Aeolus and Truant led the way. The war canoe followed, with even strokes
of the paddles, a great improvement over the first “ragtime” efforts.
Then the other canoes, by ones and twos, swept out from shore to round
the point into Merrymeeting Bay.</p>
<p>“Look out, Hilary, don’t go out too far. The current is awfully strong
out there. Look at Eloise and Helen. My! Are they going to make it? They
may have an upset if they are carried down to those rocks.”</p>
<p>Eloise, Evelyn and Helen had gone out too far from the Merrymeeting
banks and were struggling against both current and tide, which was going
out. But they paddled away, while the Midget was watching to see if they
needed help, and had just started toward the girls when they drew out of
the stronger current and came up to the other boats.</p>
<p>“Why did we start so late and against the tide?” asked Lilian.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you hear about the canoes? The men had to go after them this
morning. The tide came up so high last night and the girls had not drawn
them up high enough. Usually somebody goes down to see if everything is
all right, but of course on the night of an unusually high tide it would
be forgotten, by the ‘irony of fate’. Four canoes were missing.”</p>
<p>“Did they find them?”</p>
<p>“Yes; some of the Boothbay folks got them and took them in there.”</p>
<p>“Look at our flotilla, Hilary. The English fleet isn’t in it with us!”</p>
<p>“It is lovely, isn’t it? I just love these blue canoes. But ‘bucking the
tide’ is no joke. This is hard work. However, think of the howl that
would have gone up from one and all of us if we had had to give up the
trip!”</p>
<p>“Don’t you wish we had Campbell along?”</p>
<p>“I do indeed, and for no sentimental reason either, Miss Lilian.”</p>
<p>On they paddled. Soon the launches were far in advance. The distance to
the island seemed to increase. Eloise, Helen and Evelyn had caught up
with Hilary and Lilian and shouted across occasionally.</p>
<p>“Look at Jenkie with Mr. Clark. Isn’t she lucky? See the way he paddles,
and look at the way she just dips her oars. Listen, she’s calling.”</p>
<p>“Come on, girls; this isn’t hard.”</p>
<p>“O, no, Jenkie, not with Mistah Clahk to do the wuhk!” replied Evelyn.</p>
<p>For the first long pull it promised to be a hard one. But after the
launches had reached the island and delivered passengers and cargo, the
Truant returned to pick up girls that were too tired and tow their
canoes to port.</p>
<p>The picnic went on as picnics do, but not all picnickers breathe the
exhilarating air furnished by the Maine breezes. The girls were soon
quite rested, though arms and shoulders might ache a little. Bathing
suits and towels had been brought along for a good swim. The lunch was
pronounced wonderful and good appetites made quick work of disposing of
it. “Seconds” and “Thirds” were permitted for sandwiches and fruit. Some
of the girls had brought books or magazines. Others had fancy work. Some
looked for new birds or new flowers to add to their number of points. As
all the common flowers had been brought in, each new flower counted a
point. All the girls had helped gather wood for the fire. Ah, how much
better bacon tastes cooked outdoors! Besides the fun, the consciousness
of being able to paddle one’s own canoe, both literally and
figuratively, was the chief result of this picnic, and every trip in
this beautiful country made the girls love it more.</p>
<p>The paddle home was almost as hard as that to the island, for a wind
came up, blew in their faces, and made the bay choppy. Tide again was
against them. In the waves made by the wind and those from passing
steamers all the skill of the paddlers was called into requisition. But
the presence of the launches gave confidence to any of the girls who
needed it, and the canoes rode the little white-capped waves most
prettily.</p>
<p>“Send for Edna, Cathalina, to rub my back,” exclaimed Hilary stretched
at length on her cot. “Bring on your Sloan’s liniment, Absorbine Junior
and St. Jacob’s oil! Look out, Betty!”—as Betty plumped herself down by
Hilary and began to rub a shoulder. “Deal gently, Elizabeth; how are
your own arms?”</p>
<p>“There were so many to paddle in the war canoe; we hardly got tired a
bit. But I’m just as hungry as if I hadn’t eaten three sandwiches and
other things in proportion at the island.”</p>
<p>“So’m I. Dot has a birthday tonight, so we’ll have ice cream and cake.
Maybe you will be asked to the birthday table, Hilary.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so, too many little folks that Dot will want.”</p>
<p>“But she is so crazy about June.”</p>
<p>“True; but I’m not June. However, we’ll all have cake, even if it is not
birthday cake.”</p>
<p>“The supper bell; O, joyful sound! Are the rest of you lame old ladies
going to manage to get down to the dining-room on time?”</p>
<p>Hilary rose with exaggerated stiffness. “I’m going to apply for a
position as special guide to take venturesome tourists through the St.
Lawrence rapids in a canoe.”</p>
<p>The girls from Squirrels’ Inn were a little late in reaching the
dining-room, though others were still gathering and the bell for order
before grace had not yet rung. Dotty came dancing from the birthday
table to show them her birthday bouquet.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it lovely? The camp mother made it. See? Every little flower is
made of a dee-lish-shus piece of candy in the center, with all colors of
paper for petals, and this lacy white paper to hold it all, twisted
tinfoil and all! I wish I could have had you big girls at my table too.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Dotty,” said Hilary, “it is just as it should be.”</p>
<p>The birthday table was especially decorated, with fresh bouquets and
extra goodies which had been sent to Dorothy. Packages were piled at
Dorothy’s place; happy faces surrounded the table. But the supreme
moment was when the tables were cleared for the last course and Dot went
over to the kitchen for her birthday cake. The girls watched as the
candles were lit for her and the cake put into her hands. Slowly and
carefully she walked, watching lest her green candles blow out, while
the girls sang:</p>

<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:1.4em; '>  Happy birthday to you!”</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>“Dorothy rah! Dorothy rah! Rah-rah, Dorothy!”</p>
<p>“Did you notice her name on the frosting?—Dorothy, in cinnamon drops.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Isabel, I certainly did,” said Virgie. “I never had a birthday
celebration in my life. I wish my birthday came in camp time.”</p>
<p>“When does it come?”</p>
<p>“September first! Not even in school time!”</p>
<p>“My, what a pity. You could almost have one.”</p>
<p>“I’ve half a mind to change it, put it in August some time. Why not?”
asked Virgie, laughing.</p>
<p>“There was a girl that did that once,” said Frances. “She went clear
through with it, then somebody told.”</p>
<p>“What did they do to her?”</p>
<p>“Nothing. They were too kind.”</p>
<p>“I suppose she wanted it so awfully. But mercy, I’m having too many
kinds of good times that I never dreamed of having a year ago not to be
able to stand not having a birthday cake.”</p>
<p>“We’ll just have a celebration at school for you. Our first feast shall
be in your honor.”</p>
<p>“I thank you!” and Virgie bowed formally. “Patty said that we have four
birthdays on the same day next week with four separate birthday cakes.
Maybe we’ll get a taste of one yet, Isabel.”</p>

<h2 id='chXII' title='XII: THE JUNIORS'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE JUNIORS</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>June, of the Juniors, was having, in her own words, the “greatest fun of
her lifetime.” Never had she lived with so many other little girls.
Laugh-a-lot had overflowed into “Little Content”, a tent next to the
shingled cabin, and “Hillside Inn”, located where the name indicates.
The latter tent had its name conspicuously posted on a board, though the
sign artist found that there was not enough room for the last “N” and
put up the sign without it.</p>
<p>The youngest of the Juniors were two eight-year-olds, Dorothy Freneau
and Josephine Rathmell. Dorothy was short and chubby, with appealing
blue eyes and engaging ways. Josephine was taller, thin, with olive
complexion and short, fluffy, dark hair. Despite the difference in size
and complexion these little girls were called the Twins, because of
their years, their birthdays only a week or so apart. “Dot” and “Jo”
were great favorites in camp, loved but not spoiled, for neither was
babyish nor selfish and in all the camp sports or trips each wanted to
play her part well. As Dotty had taken a special fancy to June both
girls were often found in her company.</p>
<p>Among June’s other friends was an enterprising child of Isabel’s type,
who had copied her brothers and who sought June’s companionship, largely
because she was so different. June, like Hilary, was of the consoling,
steady type that makes a good confidante, and this ten-year-old had more
than one woe to confide. For June herself camp life was doing a good
deal in helping her to overcome her timidity. She learned and tried to
practice the definition of a “good sport”, which was pinned up in the
dining-room:</p>
<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline'>“Somebody happy, jolly and kind;</div>
<div class='cbline'>If she loses a game,—well, never mind.”</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There were some things which she found it hard to take pleasantly in
this first experience with the companionship of a group. She hated the
mischievous tricks that some of them played, but tried to be patient
whenever she was the victim. She learned to look in her bed to see if
either caterpillar or pebbles were there, and made it over pleasantly
whenever it was “made French”. One child upset a box of blueberries upon
it when it was open to air, and one morning her suit-case was missing,
found later in a distant klondike, where it had been carried “for fun”.</p>
<p>“They think that it is really funny,” she confided to Hilary. “Several
times I’ve had it upon the tip of my tongue to say as Mother has said to
us ‘anybody could do that; a smart person wouldn’t even think it funny’,
but I can’t do it, since I’m not bringing them up as Mother is us, and
then they’d think I was mad. I must be different not to like it. And I
did hate it about the sheets. Will the stain come out? Of course that
was just an accident.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that. Mother gave us common sheets and she knows that
we can’t be as careful in camp life, though there is no sense in being
destructive. Just get along as nicely as you can and keep pleasant. We
have always had to be careful, for financial reasons, and then there is
good sense in having some ‘thrift’. I don’t imagine that the parents of
these girls want them to be as careless with their own and other
people’s property as a few of them are.”</p>
<p>“I’ll try to do the best I can, but it seems so stingy not to lend
things to the girls, and if I do I don’t have them when I need them. The
other day when it was so wet Bess had my rubbers and I got my feet wet,
and the head councillor met me and said, ‘Why, Junie, where are your
rubbers?’ and I almost cried!”</p>
<p>“That is more serious. I don’t know what you will do except to refuse to
lend them. Wrap them in a paper and keep them in your trunk if
necessary.”</p>
<p>“Then they’ll say I’m mean.”</p>
<p>“Let ’em. They all have or have had the necessary things; let them look
after their own. Don’t you remember how it has been said again and
again, ‘Don’t lend; don’t borrow.’ And just yesterday the head
councillor said, ‘It is <i>not</i> selfish to look after your own property.’
Those few careless girls make a lot of trouble for her, I guess. Notice
all the things that are left in the office or assembly hall.”</p>
<p>“I really do like that generous kind that will give anything they have,”
said June thoughtfully. “Bess would give away her head, I guess; but her
rubbers are gone and her sweater and a lot of other things and that is
why she borrows. I can’t borrow, someway, so I come to grief if I don’t
have my own things.”</p>
<p>“A lot of the girls just leave everything to their mothers, you know.
They haven’t lived in a minister’s family where things have to be
managed and everybody has to take a little responsibility.”</p>
<p>“O, Hilary, I forgot. We have to have the doings next Friday or Saturday
night. Have you any ideas? Our councillor said for each of us to think
up something if we could and we are to meet after supper tonight to talk
it over.”</p>
<p>“How about some Mother Goose tableaux, or some charades for the girls to
guess?”</p>
<p>“O, yes; that would be fun,” said June, clapping her hands. “Will you
help me get dressed that night?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll help in whatever you get up if your councillor wants me to.
I’ll see you at supper if I have any more ideas.”</p>
<p>The meeting of the committee after supper was a momentous occasion. What
they were planning had to be kept a secret from the other girls or the
entertainment would lose that element of surprise in which half the fun
consists.</p>
<p>“I just can’t think of a thing!” declared Dot. “O, yes I can, too,—why I
can do something that we girls at school did in a drill one time.”</p>
<p>“Good, Dotty,” said the councillor, “you can do it by yourself or show
one or two of the other girls how to do it with you. Now that is your
responsibility. Can we depend upon you to do it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll get it up all myself.”</p>
<p>One thought of one thing, another of something else. Hilary was brought
in, and another meeting planned for the following morning before games.
A long hike was planned for Friday, which would probably tire the girls,
and caused a postponement of the Junior entertainment to Saturday night.
But this pleased the Juniors as giving them more time. Dot and Jo were
practicing some thing very hard to do. June was fixing something of
Hilary’s to wear. Borrowing for theatricals was considered proper!</p>
<p>Curtains were up for the entertainment this time. The Junior councillors
had gathered in the Juniors to dress for their parts. Important as it
seemed, some little folks will forget to note the time which will slip
away so fast!</p>
<p>“Isn’t it nice to have curtains?” said Jo. “When we had Little Red
Riding-Hood we had to get things ready in the dark.”</p>
<p>The first number on the program was a concert by the world’s greatest
artists. Madame Galli-Curci appeared first, accompanied by Lilian with
the guitar. The small prima donna had refused to sing anything
appropriate to her years. “No, sir, I won’t sing a child’s song. Yes, of
course, I know ’em. How could I help it, when we sing them at school?
But it has to be a grown-up song or else I won’t be Galli-Curci!”</p>
<p>“Madame Shumann-Heink sings ‘Holy Night’.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t call that a child’s song. Besides it is summer now. What
songs do you know, Lilian? I can learn anything in two days.”</p>
<p>“Remarkable child!” sighed the councillor who was helping. “Get her
anything she wants, Lilian.”</p>
<p>Jo folded her arms and stood calmly to wait what would be done. Lilian
came to the rescue, and after trying over a number of songs she found
that Jo was familiar with the tune of “O Promise Me”.</p>
<p>This rendered that night in a high childish voice created quite as much
of a sensation as the real prima donna could have desired, particularly
in respect to the pronunciation of the words and division of syllables.
“You-an-dI” and “or-gunn” were especially appreciated by the audience,
who were apparently carried away by the effective close, “O, prom-uss
me, O, prom-muss me!” Enthusiastic encores brought Jo back several
times, but while she handled her train with ease and bowed and smiled
with all the graces of the stage, she refused to repeat her effort and
had not learned an encore.</p>
<p>After the rest of the artists had appeared, four little girls gave a
drill as wooden dolls, while one of the councillors played “Narcissus.”
This was Dot’s idea.</p>
<p>The Mother Goose tableaux were especially pretty. They included Old King
Cole, Little Boy Blue and other of the well know classics which were
quickly guessed by the audience. Little Bo-peep had her crook and was
shading her eyes as she looked for her sheep. Simple Simon was fishing
in his mother’s pail. The cupboards in the wall which had been a part of
the original farm-house kitchen were just the thing for old Mother
Hubbard.</p>
<p>“The last two numbers will be charades,” announced Dot. “The first is
two words, in one act.”</p>
<p>The curtains were drawn aside, revealing one happy little girl curled up
on a rug. She was deeply absorbed in a book, and ate candy from a box
close at hand. The audience hesitated, whispered, and finally some one
called “Little Content”. That was the right answer, and the curtains
closed. When they were again drawn they disclosed the entire group of
Juniors sitting upon the floor and laughing. Having been prepared by the
previous charade, the audience at once cried, “Laugh-a-lot!
Laugh-a-lot!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with this team? That’s the third time, Isabel, that
you’ve knocked Pat over, and Betty got hit in the eye.”</p>
<p>“Y’see, you ran out of your place and were in my way.”</p>
<p>“You dropped your comb, Bertha.”</p>
<p>“What’s the score?”</p>
<p>“Twelve to seven.”</p>
<p>“Whose favor?”</p>
<p>“The Pennacooks’.”</p>
<p>“Come on, Kennebecs!”</p>
<p>“Wake up, girls; don’t let ’em beat us!”</p>
<p>“Did everybody serve? Begin all over? All right; I don’t want to cheat.”</p>
<p>“That’s the way, keep it up; send it back.”</p>
<p>“Out.”</p>
<p>It is volley ball, in which two of the six teams are playing. Back and
forth flies the big ball. Like the flag, it must not touch the ground.
Girlish figures run hither and thither, strike the ball and send it
flying over the net to the opposite side, where the performance is
repeated. Good spirit prevails. They are playing to win, for the sake of
the team and for personal reasons as well; but however eager or
disappointed they may feel, no one shows ill will. Pride and camp spirit
prevent that. Sometimes it is a little hard to accept the hindrances
which the little girls or the less experienced ones offer, but as a rule
these are coached and encouraged by the rest of the team. A good play is
applauded by both sides.</p>
<p>“Now try it, June. That’s it. Put a little more strength into it next
time. Hit it hard and send it a little higher. You get another turn.
Toss it up and then bang away!”</p>
<p>“Send it to me and I’ll hit it over.”</p>
<p>June takes her stand, tosses up the ball and hits it. It goes off to the
side, but one of the girls who stands there, hits it over the net. Back
it comes and over it goes again, sent by a hard blow from Hilary.</p>
<p>“They’re coming up fine.”</p>
<p>“Thirteen to ten.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” cried the captain of the Kennebecs. “Where’s some wood?” she
cries, rapping on her head. “Come on, Kennebecs!”</p>
<p>“Thirteen to eleven,” announces the referee, as the Kennebecs score
another point. The game grows exciting.</p>
<p>“Good work, Lilian.”</p>
<p>“Get it, Margaret. O, you weren’t quick enough!”</p>
<p>“Be ready.”</p>
<p>“Come on, Pennacooks!”</p>
<p>“What’s the score?”</p>
<p>“Fourteen to twelve.”</p>
<p>“Betty’s serve.”</p>
<p>The Pennacooks, nerved to greater effort by their higher score and the
increasing score of the Kennebecs made the fifteenth point and won the
game. Two games out of three they had thus won, and the Kennebecs
generously gave the first cheer for the winning team.</p>
<p>“No hurry, girls,” said Lilian, dropping down in the shade. A red-eyed
vireo in the bushes had not stopped rooting for both sides during the
game, and an olive-sided flycatcher had come out to sit on a wire by one
of the tennis courts and inquire which side beat. So Hilary interpreted
their remarks, as she pointed them out to the girls.</p>
<p>Hilary, June, Eloise, Lilian and Cathalina were among the defeated
Kennebecs, while Isabel, Nora, Betty and Frances were of the victorious
Pennacooks. Helen and Marion played with the Ossipees, who were at
present playing baseball down on what might be called Merrymeeting
Green, near the water front.</p>
<p>“The baseball games aren’t over yet,” Lilian continued, “and besides
they’ll have to rest.” The girls stretched out or curled up where tall
bushes and some trees offered shade.</p>
<p>“Whom do we play in basketball?”</p>
<p>“The Ossipees.”</p>
<p>“Well, we must beat them,” declared Hilary. “I’ll simply pass away if we
can’t.”</p>
<p>“Team work, girls,” said Eloise, who was captain.</p>
<p>“My, it’s hot this morning in the sun,” said Lilian. “Cathalina, I’ll
beat you in tennis this afternoon, if we can get a court after rest
hour.”</p>
<p>“All right as to playing. As to beating, we’ll see.”</p>
<p>“You’re the two champions among the Seniors, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“I guess so,” replied Lilian.</p>
<p>“Of course you’ll get a court, then. And you’ll have an audience, too.
Which court do you want? We’ll see that you get it. I’m terribly
thirsty. Let’s go over to the club house and get a drink. We can sit on
the porch till the girls come. There’s always a wonderful breeze there.
I suppose your team is at baseball next, Nora?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and we must be going, too,—come on, girls.”</p>
<p>This was a busy week in athletics. The July tournaments were on. Tennis
was being played off as could be managed about the courts. The schedule
was posted in the club house. Lilian and Cathalina were easily the best
in tennis and had yet their match to play.</p>
<p>In volley ball, baseball and basketball, the six teams played against
each other. Every girl in camp was assigned to a team, though a few were
excused for some special reason, and only took part in the games at
times. There was not the intense excitement or the temptation to
over-strain that there is sometimes in the games between schools; but
there was great interest in these active sports and a very human desire
to excel.</p>
<p>Volley ball and tennis were played upon courts, which were located on
the level ground back of the camp buildings. Beyond the courts stretched
a big meadow, partly level, but sloping down to bushes and trees along
the back water of the Kennebec. On the other side of courts and meadow
were bushes and trees and the charming road or lane which wound along
past Sunset Rock, the pine grove and the birches, through Merrymeeting
boundaries, to the world of the mainland beyond. Just back of the club
house and at the beginning of this little road were the posts and
baskets for the basketball games.</p>
<p>That afternoon, though the sun was still hot, the cool Maine breeze
stirred the sunny locks of Lilian and Cathalina as the girls met for the
final test of skill in tennis. Both girls played well, having played for
several years. A few councillors and a number of the girls occupied a
bench or two, or found seats on the grass beside the favorite court, the
one nearest the lane.</p>
<p>“Now, Lil,” said Cathalina, as swinging their racquets they walked
toward the court, “you are such a dear, that only I’m afraid of one
thing.”</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>“That you will hate to beat me and won’t play your best.”</p>
<p>“I thought that all out, Cathalina, and I think that the only fair thing
is for each of us to play her level best. And don’t you let me beat you
because you hate to beat me, or get lazy and do not care!”</p>
<p>“I guess that is the more likely,” acknowledged Cathalina, laughing.
“I’m a lazy-bones, but I promise to do my best. Beware!”</p>
<p>“Here comes the champs!”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter with the champions?”</p>
<p>“Rah, rah, Lil!”</p>
<p>“Rah, rah, Cathie!”</p>
<p>The comparatively small company gathered near the court were more
audience than rooters, and applauded impartially both players, though
Isabel never failed to cheer some good play by Cathalina, and Virgie
shouted at the top of her Western lungs for Lilian.</p>
<p>“Look at Lil. Good work, Lilian; you have a wicked serve!”</p>
<p>“Fifteen—love.”</p>
<p>So evenly matched were the girls that most of the games were deuce
games. Fourteen were played before Lilian won the first set.</p>
<p>The second set was won by Cathalina, who played with brilliance and
determination. Her most effective play was what the girls cheered as a
“slam”, almost impossible to return, which she delivered with surprising
force for one so slight. This she had learned from Philip. But Lilian,
too, had a brother, had been accustomed to playing with Cathalina, and
was not as much disturbed by this play as were the more inexperienced
girls against whom Cathalina had been playing during these days of
tournament.</p>
<p>“Do you read my mind, Lil,” asked Cathalina once, when Lilian so quickly
reached the particular spot back in the court where she was needed.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Cathalina; that was a peach,” said Lilian, as one of
Cathalina’s returns went an inch or so outside.</p>
<p>“Great cut, Lilian,” remarked Cathalina, when Lilian’s ball went over
the net, hit the right spot, and refused to bounce to Cathalina’s
racquet.</p>
<p>In the third set, excitement rose among the spectators. Endurance was
not Cathalina’s strong point and she grew tired, but played on
apparently as well as ever. She had won four games, Lilian five, and the
score of the present game stood forty to thirty in Lilian’s favor, when
she returned, backhand, a difficult ball from Cathalina. It dropped over
the net and Cathalina was not quite quick enough to reach the net from
the back of the court. The game was Lilian’s and wild applause
proclaimed her winner of the tennis tournament.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the bushes two deeply interested spectators had arrived by
way of the lane. Having been informed by Jo and June, who were playing
“jacks” on the club house floor, that Cathalina and Lilian were
finishing the tournament, two masculine visitors decided to go to the
courts by the back way and remain unseen if possible while watching the
progress of the game. June had suggested it, saying that it might “fuss”
the girls, since they were not expecting company.</p>
<p>“You’re a bright, kind little June-bug, aren’t you?” asked Campbell, and
June gave him one of her happy smiles, as he strode off with Philip Van
Buskirk.</p>
<p>“Well-well! Which will you root for, Philip, sister or best girl?”</p>
<p>“We’ll not dare root for anybody if we have to keep out of sight.”</p>
<p>“Wise reply. True, and doesn’t give you away.”</p>
<p>Philip scarcely knew where loyalty demanded his presence. He was proud
of his pretty little sister, but every time he looked at the graceful
Lilian he fell more deeply in love.</p>
<p>“How about a love set with Lilian, old man?” queried Campbell.</p>
<p>“I’ll play one any day,” replied the unembarrassed Philip.</p>
<p>“But ‘love’ means ‘nothing’,” added Campbell.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately so.”</p>
<p>“Good for Cathalina!” exclaimed Campbell, with cousinly regard, at an
especially good play. Before this he had found where Hilary was sitting,
and did not find the game so engrossing that he could not include Hilary
in his line of vision.</p>
<p>Then came the last plays, Lilian’s victory, and Philip found himself
watching her, as she received congratulations and talked happily with
the girls. The boys waited a few moments till most of the crowd were
moving off, a few Greycliff girls still around Lilian and Cathalina,
then walked around into sight.</p>
<p>“A surprise for you, Cathalina,” called Campbell.</p>
<p>Turning, the girls saw Philip and Campbell, and with many exclamations
of wonder and pleasure, went to meet them.</p>
<p>“Why, Philip Van Buskirk!” exclaimed Cathalina. “Why didn’t you write
that you were coming?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t know it myself till the last minute, Kitten. Say I was proud of
your playing. And Lilian, that was great!”</p>
<p>“Were you back there all the time?”</p>
<p>“Just for the last two games. It was all we could do to keep still and
not join in the rooting, but June warned us not to appear before the
games were over.”</p>
<p>“When did you arrive, Philip?” asked Hilary.</p>
<p>“This morning. Campbell wrote that this would be a good time to come, I
wired him and came. He says that there is to be a picnic up here
tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed; we entertain the Boothbay boys.”</p>
<p>“Let’s sit down right here and talk,” suggested Cathalina, moving toward
the benches. “Then we can show you around a little.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid we’ll have to put that off till tomorrow,” said Campbell,
“if we go down to camp with the tide. But we can visit a little while.”
Thus speaking, he waved Hilary to a seat next to Cathalina on a bench
and dropped on the grass at her feet.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XIV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>PICNICKERS FROM BOOTHBAY CAMP</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>“O, dear! It’s going to rain today, Eloise, look at the fog!”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t mean anything up here, Isabel.”</p>
<p>“But it was so cloudy last night, too. If anything happens to spoil the
picnic I’ll be mad.”</p>
<p>“Nothing will,” contributed Frances. “If it storms, they’ll wait till
the storm is over and then come. And if it keeps on raining, we can have
fun in the club house and the dining room. But I don’t think that it
will rain.”</p>
<p>“I want to see what happens on a picnic when the boys are here,” said
Isabel. “When do they come?”</p>
<p>“Right after rest hour, probably. They have to get ready, of course, and
the Aeolus won’t leave here till after dinner.”</p>
<p>“Why the Aeolus?”</p>
<p>“There are so many boys that the big boat will go after them.”</p>
<p>“And what do we do?”</p>
<p>“The program will be announced at breakfast or dinner, I think. Probably
there will be some games, different things to make us get acquainted. We
are supposed to be the hostesses and will show the boys around the
grounds if they want us to, but I imagine that the little boys will want
to tear around by themselves. The older boys will pay more attention to
us, though. They will all be very polite and appreciative, for their
head councillor is quite particular about their manners.”</p>
<p>It was almost three o’clock when the boats appeared from Boothbay Camp.
The day had cleared, though occasional clouds obscured the afternoon
sun. The Aeolus came gliding in, full of boys of all sizes, with their
councillors. Many of them wore white duck in honor of the occasion.
Others were in the usual camp uniform. Standing in or on the Aeolus,
they hailed Merrymeeting, first with the Boothbay, then with the
Merrymeeting yell, and were answered by such girls as happened to be
about, for the place of reception was at the club house.</p>
<p>Cathalina was watching for Philip and Campbell, whom she intended to
have a delightful time if she could manage it, and proud she was to
introduce them to all the interesting girls. Campbell, in turn,
introduced the other councillors and other boys, and the picnic was well
started. The younger boys and girls had a hare and hounds chase, which
was somewhat strenuous for the boys in white duck, but they came out of
it in good humor, if a little warm and disheveled.</p>
<p>“They shall have their heart’s desire, the dears,” thought Cathalina, as
she stood apart for a moment and looked at the chatting, laughing
company. It was not hard to manage it, for Campbell never got very far
from Hilary, and Phil was usually where he could quickly reach Lilian.</p>
<p>“Pardon me, Philip, I want Lilian to take you around a little and show
you Marshmallow Point and the pine grove, and, Hilary, will you take
Campbell? There is Sunset Rock, too, and the lane. The boys must see all
the places we rave about. I’ll join you later.” Cathalina had seen to it
that neither Hilary nor Lilian had planned to take part in any of the
games that were arranged for, and had frankly told them why. “I want you
to be free to entertain Campbell and Philip. The other girls and I will
help with the rest.”</p>
<p>Neither Lilian nor Hilary, then, were surprised or embarrassed, and the
four strolled first down to Marshmallow Point, properly called Chopp’s
Point, where they viewed the remains of many a camp fire and sat on the
rocks to talk of their schools, the camps, and many other interests both
serious and amusing. But when they topped the hill again, Lilian and
Philip turned toward the pine grove, while Hilary and Campbell walked on
past the club house to the little road and Sunset Rock. No explanation
seemed necessary.</p>
<p>“This is where we find the cranberry plants,” Hilary was saying, as she
stooped to pick a bit of the vine with an unripe cranberry on it. “Our
prettiest blueberries are near Sunset Rock.”</p>
<p>“Where is that?” asked Campbell.</p>
<p>“Up this way.”</p>
<p>Lilian was just pointing out the pine grove to Philip and they had
turned to go there when they looked back to see Hilary and Campbell
turning the other way, but looking back to wave friendly hands.</p>
<p>“There are the most beautiful rocks of all in the pine grove, Philip,
and along the shore of Merrymeeting Bay.”</p>
<p>Down the narrow trail they walked into the grove, Lilian leading. Little
blueberry bushes, prickly juniper, bright green moss, sprawling
arborvitæ, tall sweet ferns and other greenery lined the way. Then they
reached the thick carpet of pine needles and climbed down a natural
stairway, none too regular, made of pine roots padded with moss and
brown pine needles.</p>
<p>“This is the way to the swimming cove,” said Lilian, pointing to the
rocks and the water, which appeared through the trees. “The hunters’
cabin is on in that direction, a short walk. Would you like to go on
there?”</p>
<p>“I’d rather sit out on the rocks, I believe, and talk to you while I
have the chance,” replied Philip quickly, “but wherever you want to go,
I’ll be glad to tag along.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather visit, too, Philip,” responded Lilian pleasantly, as she
looked about for the best location. “Let’s climb back up to my favorite
rock. We’ll be close at hand if the girls want us, and by ourselves if
many of the folks come down to the grove.”</p>
<p>Lilian’s sweater made a comfortable cushion for both as perched upon the
firm old Maine rock they began to talk to each other of their dreams and
ambitions. It was just as engrossing as it had been upon their ride from
Rochester to Buffalo. While they talked, the bell rang for swimming.</p>
<p>“They are back from the hare and hounds chase and that is the call for
swimming; do you want to go, Philip?”</p>
<p>“No; do you?”</p>
<p>“Not a bit; Tell me some more about your pipe organ lessons. Which do
you like best, organ or piano? I suppose piano is easier.”</p>
<p>“My old organ teacher and I quarrel every once in a while about that. He
began with piano, too, and likes it, of course, but says that anybody
who gives pipe organ study a fair trial likes it better, so many more
effects and so on, and so much power in the organ. But I hold out for
piano still, though I thoroughly enjoy the pipe organ work and do not
find it so hard because of having played piano so long. One reads music,
you know, and has the fingering of keys and the idea of expression and
all.”</p>
<p>“Have you had harmony and counterpoint?”</p>
<p>“Yes; have you?”</p>
<p>“No, but I must, because I try to make up little songs and do not know
whether the accompaniments are right or not. O, dear, I’ll never catch
up to you!”</p>
<p>Philip’s face showed how little he thought Lilian needed anything more
to make her perfect, as he replied, “You are way beyond me, I’m afraid.
Let me help you with accompaniment. I’d love to try it! Send me the
melody and words and what idea of accompaniment you have, whatever you
have written, and I will see if you have broken any of the rules at
least, and if you want me to, I’ll perhaps suggest some chords that
would be good.”</p>
<p>“O, that will be wonderful!” Lilian clasped her hands in delight. “But
wouldn’t it bother you too much? You will be so busy with your own
work.”</p>
<p>“I’d consider it a privilege.”</p>
<p>“Well, you are nice!” But something in Philip’s tone made Lilian hurry
on to say, “I have always wanted to be a singer, Philip, but Mother says
it’s an awful life. She says that I can have the lessons and sing
without being a concert singer. But still sometimes I think I would like
to try it.”</p>
<p>“I’m very fond of music, you know,” replied Philip, “but Father needs me
in the business, and I like his line, too. I want a regular job. I think
every man ought to have one, and as I don’t care to be a public
performer or a music teacher, I think I’ll just keep it for recreation,
boring my family with occasional practice and much private enjoyment of
my own.”</p>
<p>“From what Cathalina says, I judge that your family is never bored.”</p>
<p>“They do seem to stand it, but they are a long-suffering lot. And
lately,” Philip’s face sobered, and he twirled the sweet fern that he
held, “I’ve been planning for a musical wife, that is ... she’s pretty
young now ... if I get home from war to ask her.”</p>
<p>Lilian’s heart tried to turn over, but did not succeed, and as he spoke
of the war she looked at him quickly,—“O, Phil!”</p>
<p>“We are bound to get into it, Father thinks, and says that when we do
get in I may go, not before. Campbell and I and most of our friends are
making our plans accordingly.”</p>
<p>Silence for a few moments. Lilian played with a sprig of blueberries,
which Philip had picked for her, and Philip still twirled the bit of
sweet fern.</p>
<p>“Say Lilian, would you mind writing to me?”</p>
<p>“I’d love to, Philip.”</p>
<p>“Right along, I mean, not just once in a while. I’d like to tell you
things, and know what you are doing all the time and where you are.”</p>
<p>Philip spoke so earnestly that Lilian almost gasped. Matters were moving
rapidly in this new friendship.</p>
<p>“You see you’re,—well, you’re different. I never met a girl like you.
You’re so <i>sweet</i>, you know!” and Philip put his long brown fingers for
just a moment over the little tanned hand on the rock.</p>
<p>Lilian’s blue eyes met Phil’s dark ones and fell before them, while
Philip watched a sweet, serious face surrounded by a bright halo of hair
on which the afternoon sun was shining.</p>
<p>“Here come Cathalina and Eloise, Philip,” and Lilian waved a hand to the
approaching girls.</p>
<p>“It’s about time for the supper, Lilian,” said Cathalina, “and I thought
we’d better look up you folks. Supper is half an hour earlier, you know,
and I wasn’t sure that you knew it. Whoo-oo, everybody!”</p>
<p>Cathalina raised her voice a little and repeated her announcement of
“almost supper-time”, that a group of boys and girls down on the cove
rocks might hear her. “Where are Hilary and Campbell, Lilian?”</p>
<p>“They started to walk down the lane to Sunset Rock, to see birds, I
guess.”</p>
<p>“Yes, to see birds,” laughed Cathalina, as she and Eloise ran back along
the winding path. “I feel as if I were an entertainment committee, don’t
you, Elo’?”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed, with young councillors and boys and girls to meet and
introduce. I hope that everybody has been having a good time.”</p>
<p>“I know that Phil and Campbell are! And there aren’t any lonesome
looking youngsters hanging around anyhow. Everybody has had something to
do or somebody to talk to.”</p>
<p>For the cafeteria supper, the “bread line” was arranged with the purpose
of making it easy for the boys and girls to be grouped together while
eating their supper. First a girl, then a boy, they filed into the
dining-room, past the tables which had been arranged cafeteria fashion,
the girls’ young councillors serving. Then out by the other door went
the long line, carrying their suppers to be eaten upon the green.
“Seconds” were permitted, except for ice cream and cake. The quick
disappearance of supplies and the merry conversation among the
picnickers indicated a good time. After the councillors had had their
picnic lunch and the tables were moved back, music and games occupied
the company till time for leave-taking.</p>
<p>“I shall be up tomorrow, if nothing happens,” said Philip to the girls.
“And if Campbell can get away I’ll try to drag him along.”</p>
<p>“Yes; ‘try to drag me along’ is good!” said Campbell. “If he does not
select a time when I can get away there will be trouble.”</p>
<p>“How soon must you leave, Philip?” asked Cathalina.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow evening. If you have anything to send home, have it ready when
I come up. Good-bye, everybody. We have had a wonderful time.”</p>
<p>With parting gestures and camp yells, the manly crew boarded their boats
and took their departure.</p>

<h2 id='chXV' title='XV: A SHORE DINNER'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XV</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>A SHORE DINNER</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>“What is this ‘shore dinner’, Marion, that I hear the girls talking
about?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Betty; ask Frances.”</p>
<p>“O, Frances!”</p>
<p>“Whoo-hoo,—in a minute.” Frances presently came in from hanging her
bathing suit on the line outside the klondike.</p>
<p>“What is it, Betty?”</p>
<p>“The ‘shore dinner’, Frances; what is it, and where is it? I have been
hearing the girls ask, ‘O, are you going to the shore dinner?’ but
someway neglected to inquire. Do we go to some place on the shore and
have a clam chowder or something?”</p>
<p>“No. The shore dinner is of sea foods, to be sure, but we have it at New
Meadows Inn. They take us down to Bath and from there we take the
trolley car to the Inn. I went last year and want to go again. I just
love their lobster stew!”</p>
<p>“‘Love’ food, Frances?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I do, Miss Patty.”</p>
<p>“Can we stop in Bath, too?” continued Betty.</p>
<p>“Yes,—at least they always do let us shop a while.”</p>
<p>“Good! I’m going. How about you, Lilian?”</p>
<p>“O, I’m in for everything,” laughed Lilian, who was very happy these
days. “Will you go, Hilary?”</p>
<p>“Indeed I shall. Do you suppose I’d miss a trip like that? Besides, I’m
interested in this Maine country. I never was in New England before. I
hope we’ll have the trip to Augusta soon.”</p>
<p>“Is Augusta the capitol of Maine?”</p>
<p>“Listen to her! Go and ask Virgie. She studied geography last year. Are
you going, Cathalina?”</p>
<p>“Of course I am. I am particularly fond of clams and lobster.”</p>
<p>“Ugh! clams!” said Betty. “But if you all eat ’em, I will or perish in
the attempt.”</p>
<p>“Mercy, Betty! Taste ’em and go slow is my motto,” said Hilary.</p>
<p>“It is always just as well to have decided whether or not you want to
take a trip,” suggested Frances. “We’ll be asked and have to make a
quick decision perhaps. They have to know about the numbers going, of
course, both to order the dinner at the Inn and to plan about boats.
Will June go, Hilary?”</p>
<p>“She will hate to miss anything, but I’m a little afraid to have her go.
It might upset her to eat that stuff when she isn’t used to it, and the
trolley sometimes makes her sick. I’ll talk to her about it. June has
lots of sense, but once in a while she takes a spell and will or won’t
do something. The worm turns, you know.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know the feeling,” said Lilian.</p>
<p>“Why, Hilary, at times you have a touch of almost human intelligence,”
said Frances, grinning broadly. “Get little sister to decide for
herself?”</p>
<p>“That is the idea.”</p>
<p>As in odd coincidence it often happens, the shore dinner trip was
announced at breakfast. The younger girls were advised not to go, as the
only attraction was the shore dinner, and that a doubtful pleasure,
unless they liked sea foods. All who so desired, however, were permitted
to go and were to leave their names at the office at once or within a
reasonable time. The dinner would be ordered by telephone and the boats
would start in time to catch the twelve o’clock trolley car at Bath.</p>
<p>Hilary had not had time to prepare June’s mind to stay at home, but to
her relief June came running to her soon after breakfast.</p>
<p>“I’m not going, Hilary. The girls say that they just have old clams and
lobster and things like that, and I can’t eat any ice cream afterwards
at Bath because it wouldn’t go with the shore dinner, and you know that
I can’t even eat oysters. Are you going?”</p>
<p>“Yes; is there anything you’d like me to get for you at Bath?”</p>
<p>“We need some more films for the camera, and I need a bathing cap.
Mine’s all busted up.”</p>
<p>“‘Torn,’ little sister.”</p>
<p>“O, Hilary, I heard you say ‘bust’ the other day.”</p>
<p>Hilary laughed, and to change the subject, said, “I suppose you will not
object if I bring you something good.”</p>
<p>“You can’t. Don’t you remember what was said at breakfast? Nobody can
buy candy or anything to eat this trip, because they couldn’t keep from
eating it and so it’s safer not to buy ’em. See?”</p>
<p>“Sure enough. All right. Have a good time, Junie, and don’t try too many
wild stunts.” This last because it was so astounding to note how June
had ‘come out’ since coming to camp. Timid at first, afraid to get out
of her depth in the water, used to considering what would be proper for
the minister’s little girl to do, conscientious June had now thrown all
timidity to the winds, frolicked in the water like a water-sprite since
she had learned to swim under instruction, and was daily getting so much
of the group spirit that Hilary was sometimes afraid of her going to the
other extreme. But the daily exercise and happy times outdoors were
giving her much color and the scales were marking greater gain every
time that June was weighed with the rest.</p>
<p>“Think what a dress-up occasion this is, girls,” said Lilian, as she
dived into her trunk for “real clothes”. “Doesn’t it seem funny to wear
a suit and gloves?”</p>
<p>“Gloves!” exclaimed Cathalina. “<i>I’m</i> not going to wear gloves!”</p>
<p>“My, Cathalina, how you’ve changed!”</p>
<p>“Yes, isn’t it funny? But I just love to dress like a camper. I think
our costume is fine, too, and very becoming.”</p>
<p>“Going to wear your sport hat?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>All the way down to Bath the girls in the Aeolus, for the numbers were
too many for the Truant, chatted, sang, or tried to compose verses
worthy of the annual prize song. And never did the girls tire of the
beautiful river, its eddies through the Burnt Jackets, its rocky banks,
its breezes and flying or floating gulls. The trolley ride carried them
over a winding way again, up hill and down dell, past typical New
England homes in town or country. Presently they found themselves at New
Meadows Inn and were ushered into its dining-room.</p>
<p>“O, Cathalina, thank fortune you are with us,” whispered Isabel, as she
sat down next to Cathalina. “You will tell us how to eat the sea food,
won’t you?”</p>
<p>“If there is anything you do not know about,” replied Cathalina smiling.
“You’ve eaten soup?” noticing that the lobster stew was coming.</p>
<p>“Mean thing! Yes we’ve had soup before!”</p>
<p>The lobster stew proved most popular. “We don’t have lobster stew in
Dakota,” explained Virgie, as she accepted the offer of a second
helping.</p>
<p>“It is always offered here,” said Frances, “and all right to take it,
and some only care for the stew.”</p>
<p>In came the clam course. The Western girls looked at each other and
Isabel whispered to Virginia, “Shades of clams and ‘craw-daddles’ in our
old creek at home! Now tell us, Cathalina.”</p>
<p>In a low tone Cathalina replied, “Open the shell, take the clam off
where it is fastened to the shell and hold it by that end with your
fingers, dip it in the little cup of broth, then in the melted butter,
and eat it.”</p>
<p>“Why, they’re <i>good</i>,” said Isabel in surprise, “taste like oysters.”</p>
<p>Fried clams, lobsters on a little platter, New England doughnuts and a
plate of crisp cookies, pickles, and hot cups of tea or coffee, all came
in for a share of praise from these hungry campers. Coffee was not
served at camp, but permitted on these special occasions.</p>
<p>At Bath they divided into parties, a councillor in charge of each, and
scattered to the bookstores, the shoe stores, the jeweller’s, the drug
store, the dry goods stores or the ten cent store on their different
errands, till the time agreed upon to meet at the boat. Then again the
curving Aeolus took them up the river.</p>
<p>“Swimming meet tomorrow, girls,” reminded Hilary, “you going to try,
Cathalina?”</p>
<p>“No; I’m not speedy enough to race, though I’ve learned to swim so much
better already. It’s a shame that I can’t with all the summers I’ve been
at the shore. I’m going to do more of it at school next year. Are you
going to enter, Hilary?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you know that I always have to try everything. I’ll not win,
though. How about you, Virgie?”</p>
<p>“Not I. I never saw water I wanted to swim in till I came to school last
year. I love to swim now, but I’m no fish like Izzy.”</p>
<p>“There it is again! She calls me a fish now!” Isabel pretended to be
offended.</p>
<p>“Which is it, Isabel, the ‘crawl’ or the ‘overhand’?”</p>
<p>“The ‘crawl’ this time.”</p>
<p>Arrived at camp, the girls saw the Dixie from Boothbay Camp tied up at
the dock, and half way up the hill they met Campbell, who greeted them
and walked back to the club house with them.</p>
<p>“Is this the way you reward me for calling upon you?—coming home just as
I have to leave!”</p>
<p>“It is not quite that bad, I hope,” said Cathalina. “Do you have to
hurry off?”</p>
<p>“Before long, I’m afraid, whenever the ‘captain’ says the word. We
brought up some mail and other things.”</p>
<p>“Come up on the porch,” invited Cathalina.</p>
<p>One of the swings and a few chairs held the party, which included
Hilary, Eloise, Cathalina, Betty and Lilian, besides their guests. Then
Jo and June came running around, their heads scarcely to the level of
the porch floor.</p>
<p>“O, here are the girls. I wonder if they stood the sea food all right.
How’s the lobster?” inquired June, waving at Hilary and not seeing the
young man in the swing.</p>
<p>“Now what do you mean, young lady,—addressing your sister as a lobster?
Come right up and apologize!”</p>
<p>“O, Campbell, you’re so funny!” The little girls ran up the steps,
crossed the porch and June squeezed herself into the swing by Campbell,
Hilary moving over.</p>
<p>“Do you like the little boys, Campbell?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Junie, we have great times. I’ll tell you about them one of these
days. You are coming down to Boothbay on the picnic, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“O, I should say I am!”</p>
<p>“Careful, June,” warned Hilary. “Watch your speech.”</p>
<p>“Did you ever hear the story of the hunters’ cabin?”</p>
<p>“Our little cabin, Campbell?”</p>
<p>“Yes, or thereabouts.”</p>
<p>“No; except that hunters often go there during the hunting season. We
found the skeleton of a fox up there the other day. Tell us what the
story is.”</p>
<p>“The story I heard is that there was an old smuggler who had his cabin
up here, buried his treasure and was lost in a storm in the harbor. The
treasure is still buried here, ah-ha!”</p>
<p>“O, really?”</p>
<p>“Nonsense, Campbell; you’re making it up. Somebody would have found it
long ago.”</p>
<p>“I’m no authority myself, but that is one of the stories that they were
telling in camp last night.”</p>
<p>“Come up some day, Mr. Stuart, and we’ll go up there and dig!” said Jo.</p>
<p>“Where is the place?”</p>
<p>“O, just a little way—up Merrymeeting Bay,” sang Lilian. “It’s in the
pine grove.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m a busy man these days, with a lot of lively kids to look
after. Save some of the treasure for me.”</p>
<p>“Yes; you may have all we find,” generously offered Hilary.</p>
<p>“Don’t make such a rash offer, Hilary,” said Eloise, “we might really
find something. Can’t you stay to supper, Mr. Stuart?”</p>
<p>“No, thank you; it’s after five o’clock now, the next meal at six, and
we must get back to keep our especial division of boys from running off
with the place.”</p>

</div>
<p>“This is certainly one wonderful time to me,” remarked Virgie to Isabel.
“Lobster and clams on Tuesday, either a trip or something going on every
minute since, and now this picnic to the boys’ island. I have to shake
myself sometimes and say ‘remember the Maine’ or something for fear I’ll
get spoiled. And G. G. G. G. again next year!”</p>
<p>“Explain your abbreviations; something to do with Greycliff, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Yes; Greycliff Gay, Grand and Glorious. Won’t we be in fine trim for
the sports there? We girls never half appreciated our privileges there.”</p>
<p>“It takes camp life to wake us up, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Then, of course, there are so many other things that you have to
do at school.”</p>
<p>“A few lessons, for instance.”</p>
<p>“And I have too much sense to tire myself out on athletics and not get
those lessons. I say to myself every so often ‘Virginia Hope, here is
your chance to learn something; don’t miss it!’”</p>
<p>“Miss Randolph has the right idea. Do you remember how she says to us
once in a while ‘Take the hard courses, girls. Make your minds work and
you will never regret it’?”</p>
<p>“I’m going to have school and a little athletics during the year, and
camp in the summer, with lots of it, if I can, after this.”</p>
<p>About ten o’clock the girls started for Boothbay. As this was a very
popular picnic, held annually, nobody but a few councillors remained at
home. The boats went down the river with the girls singing as usual, the
weather propitious, young hearts gay.</p>
<p>“Shall we have a visit with Campbell, Hilary?” asked June, who had been
quite taken with the young man.</p>
<p>Lilian glanced roguishly at Hilary, who had replied soberly to June.
“Yes, perhaps so, but I think that he will be quite busy with the
entertaining and all.”</p>
<p>“Probably he will have a few minutes for you and Hilary, June,” said
Lilian. June perceived that there was some undercurrent of mischief, but
not understanding just what, subsided.</p>
<p>“I wish Philip were here,” said Hilary, “don’t you, Lilian?”</p>
<p>“Cathalina’s the one who would wish so the most,” said June, “because
he’s her brother.”</p>
<p>“Can’t the rest of us like him too?” asked Hilary, who was rather
regretting her blunt retort to Lilian’s teasing.</p>
<p>“O, yes; we all couldn’t help liking Philip, but sisters, of course, are
nearest.”</p>
<p>At this the girls smiled and Cathalina said, “I forgot to tell you all
about my letter from Philip. I read it in a hurry just before we left.
Somebody must have brought up some mail late last night, because I
looked just before we went to our klondike and there was nothing for any
of us in the box. He wrote that he met Lilian’s brother in New York the
other day. They just happened to be at lunch at the same place and were
eating away without knowing each other, when in walked Judge North, and
sat down by Dick, saying that he found he could get away from somewhere
after all. Then he spied Philip and Philip saw him. They had met at
Rochester, you know. Dick is reading law with his father, isn’t he,
Lilian?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Our families seem to meet by chance, don’t they?”</p>
<p>“Philip said that he is a fine fellow. He took Dick and the Judge out
home later for dinner, and Father and the Judge had a great talk over
the war, politics, business and everything. I say ‘Dick’ as if I knew
your brother, Lilian, but Philip called him that in the letter and I
have heard you speak of him so for so long. I wouldn’t think of
addressing him so familiarly.”</p>
<p>“We have been trying to call him ‘Richard’ lately, since he is so grown
up, but can’t remember to do it.”</p>
<p>“‘Richard’ is prettier,—‘Richard North’,” commented Cathalina.</p>
<p>“Dick wrote me a little scribble, too,” said Lilian. “I was so
surprised, because I rarely hear from him. We get news of each other
through Mother, of course. He said that next to Mother, Mrs. Van Buskirk
was the most lovely woman he ever met.”</p>
<p>Cathalina looked pleased at this. “O, isn’t that nice? and that he is so
loyal to his own mother, too.”</p>
<p>“You must meet our mother, Cathalina, and it would be nice if they knew
each other.” Lilian did not mention that she, too, had heard from
Philip. She intended to tell both Cathalina and Hilary, who was now her
closest friend, but the conversation in the pine grove, and the letters,
were just her own now.</p>
<p>“Here we are at Boothbay. I believe that Thorn Island is the name of the
boys’ island. We are going around to the other dock, aren’t we? These
are certainly high rocks. What a great old river the Kennebec is!
Where’s our little Canadian warbler?—O, Betty!”</p>
<p>Betty had been sitting up in front with Marion and Frances, but joined
Cathalina as soon as they landed.</p>
<p>The boys and their councillors had made great plans for the
entertainment of the girls. The picnic meal was at noon, instead of the
later time when it was celebrated at Merrymeeting. With great gallantry
the boys waited upon the girls, who enjoyed every minute. The girls had
been reminded by their head councillor that morning at breakfast that
they should show their appreciation of the courtesies offered at
Boothbay, and that they should consider how much easier it always was
for the girls to accept attentions than it was for the younger and shy
boys to offer them.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the boys played a “left-hand” game of baseball with the
girls, then staged a regular game, at which the girls rooted impartially
for both teams. There were also some singles and doubles in tennis,
which showed the boys’ skill. It must be admitted that in athletics the
boys are usually ahead. But the girls did not mind being beaten, even
when the boys were compelled to use their left hands to throw and catch,
and the boys admitted that the girls played well, “for girls”.</p>
<p>Not until after the cafeteria dinner did Campbell have time to visit
with Hilary, on whom, however, he quite often kept an eye. But when the
games were in progress, he came up and asked her to take a stroll around
with him. This singling out of Hilary did not pass unnoticed by the
other girls, and Hilary knew that she might come in for a good share of
teasing from the Merrymeeting company. But so far there was only good
comradeship between Hilary and Campbell, at least, so far as any
expression of feeling was concerned. Both were quite young, with some
school years before them and life purposes to be worked out.</p>
<p>“O, Campbell,” called June as Hilary and Campbell passed a group of the
younger boys and girls who were playing a game. “Tell me more about the
hunters’ cabin before we go, will you?”</p>
<p>“All I know is what I told you the other day. Ask Jack here. She wants
to hear those smuggler and pirate stories, Jack, that the boys were
telling.”</p>
<p>“O, could you tell me, Jack?”</p>
<p>Jack was a bright-eyed youngster of about fourteen years, who was
usually ashamed to be seen talking to a girl. But in his enforced
position as host it was different. Several of the boys and girls
immediately sat down upon the big rock near to hear or help tell the
story.</p>
<p>“Who told it in the first place, Jack?” asked one of the boys, a little
fellow of some nine years.</p>
<p>“A boy last year was telling the first I ever heard about this country.
I think he made it up, because he told us the awfullest yarns all the
time about ghosts and pirates and everything; but it was fun to listen,
and we all added to it.”</p>
<p>“Come on and tell, Jack.” June was sitting with her elbows on her knees,
her face in her hands, ready to listen in breathless interest.</p>
<p>“All right. You know that cabin up at Merrymeeting doesn’t look very
old, does it?”</p>
<p>“No. It’s made of shingles, isn’t it? Seems so silly to try to have a
story like that one about it.”</p>
<p>“Well, that wasn’t the original cabin, according to Tom’s story, but
built on the same place where the old smuggler’s cabin stood. And
somewhere around there his treasure is buried, under the cabin, in the
cracks of some of the rocks and ledges, or maybe some tree has grown
over the place. He was a terrible old fellow, a sort of retired pirate,
I guess, and Tom said that the smuggler used to live along the Kennebec
and knew that it would be a good place to hide his stores and treasures.
So he built this cabin, the old one, I mean. He would be gone for months
and then his old boat would come up the Kennebec in the night when the
tide was coming this way from the sea. And he’d drag old sacks full of
something from the boat to the cabin. He was so fierce looking that
everybody was afraid of him and if any boat was on the river when he
came along they’d get out of the way or hide somewhere till he had
passed. Once somebody heard horrible groaning from his boat,—”</p>
<p>“O, Jack!” It was getting too vivid for June.</p>
<p>“One time some people with some officers went to see what there was in
the cabin, while the old man was away. But they only found the bunks and
some food and an old chest with clothes in it.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps he just had food in the sacks and ate it up while he stayed at
the cabin,” suggested practical June.</p>
<p>“Yes. Perhaps he wasn’t a pirate. And perhaps he was,” said Jack. “You
just listen now. This is what Tom told. One night in a rainstorm a boy
that lived on a farm near the river came to shore in a canoe, because he
couldn’t get home in the wind and bucking the tide. The waves were just
<i>dashing</i> every way by the time he got into the Merrymeeting Bay, and
pretty soon the canoe went plump, crash, bang, smash, right on the rocks
near the cove. But of course the boy could swim and he kept up a minute
or two, when he was carried back from the rocks by the water, and
finally he crawled up on shore. It was in the days of Indians, and he
was afraid of being found by some of them that were not friendly or had
had too much fire-water, so he got among the bushes first. Then he saw a
light in the cabin, shining through cracks, and crept up, real still, to
see if he dared go in. There he saw the old pirate, or smuggler,
whatever he was, taking jewelry out of the chest. It flashed and
sparkled and the old man chuckled and chortled, as he ran the jewels
through his fingers. They always do that in stories, you know,” and Jack
laughed.</p>
<p>“This is a fine story,” said Jo, while Dot said, “O, I hope he didn’t
kill the boy!” and snuggled closer to June.</p>
<p>“Then the boy made a little noise, accidentally, stepped on a stick or
something, and the old man whisked the things into the chest, caught up
his gun, looked to see if his long knife was at his belt and ran out.
The boy was so scared that he scrambled up on a ledge and climbed a
tree, while the wicked old pirate hunted around, and growled to himself,
and said, ‘Nobuddy’d better come a-spyin’ on me! Nobuddy’d better come
a-spyin’ on me! I’ll give his bones to the fishes!’”</p>
<p>Jack told this part of the story with relish, while June, Jo and Dot,
with the rest of the little girls, kept big eyes on him and in
imagination sat in the tree with the boy of long ago.</p>
<p>“Did he catch the boy?”</p>
<p>“No; I guess he thought it must have been a bear or some other animal.
He went back into his cabin and barred up the door, and after a while
the boy saw the light go out. It had been shining through the chinks,
you know.”</p>
<p>“What else?”</p>
<p>“Nothin’, except that the boy waited a while and slipped down from the
tree and got away from there as soon as he could. He had an awful time
getting home through the wood, afraid of meeting a bear, and he didn’t
have his gun, of course, had lost his canoe and everything in it. By
good luck he was on the mainland, and walked home. They used to tramp
around so much and so far that I imagine that wasn’t much to him. We can
hike a good distance ourselves, you know.”</p>
<p>“The Indians really used to come to Merrymeeting, you know,” said Dot.</p>
<p>“O, yes, and maybe this old smuggler or pirate traded with ’em. But they
say that he buried a lot of treasure up there and that his ghost was
seen hunting around and whispering in a hollow voice, ‘Four from the
pine tree, Ten from the ledge, Six grey stones at the water’s edge!’”</p>
<p>“Whoever made that up,” laughed one of the boys, “got up a good one, for
there are about a million pine trees more or less, and all the stones
along the bay are grey ones, I guess, to say nothing of all the ledges
of rock and stone along there!”</p>

</div>
<p>“It’s been pouring all night and look at it now!” exclaimed Isabel in
disgust. “Goodbye our hike to Wiscasset! I had to help get the shutters
down in the night, I mean I insisted on helping, because I was awake
when the storm came up. The ground will be soaked and we can’t have
games either, can’t go out or swim or anything, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Why can’t we swim?—’cause we’d get wet?’”</p>
<p>Isabel laughed. “That seems to be a good one on me. Yes, thank fortune,
we can swim if it does rain, though I suppose if there were a real big
storm we wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>“No, because water is a great conductor of electricity. I heard Lilian
and Hilary talking about their trip and Lilian was wondering if ‘all
those dead fish’ they saw somewhere when they were on the boat had been
killed by lightning or what had killed them, and then I remember what
Father said one time, that fishes always go to the bottom or hide away
in a storm. I couldn’t be sure, though, let’s look it up some time. We
haven’t had but one thunderstorm and that wasn’t worth mentioning.”</p>
<p>“It’s too cool and nice up here for thunderstorm weather, I guess.”</p>
<p>“This looks to me like a steady, all day pour. But they’ll have
something for us to do, or we can write or read or have fun in the club
house.”</p>
<p>“We can put on our ponchos and rubbers and go out when we feel like it.
I love to be out in the rain.”</p>
<p>“Good for you, Isabel. That’s the camp spirit. Hurrah, nice old rainy
day,—going to have lots of fun.”</p>
<p>“The girls can work on the prize songs for one thing. That will come
soon. I wonder who will make the best Merrymeeting song.”</p>
<p>“Time will tell. Of course Lilian will try her hand at it, and maybe
Cathalina.”</p>
<p>An indoor field meet was announced for the usual time of games and duly
the girls arrived at the dining hall, disposing of ponchos, rain coats
and rubbers as best they could. The chairs had been moved back to leave
a large space free for the play. The megaphone announced “This is the
annual indoor field meet. Prizes are to be given to the winners in the
different contests. These contests will now begin. Will the following
girls take their places up on the floor?” Then more fun began than the
girls themselves could ever have thought up, so Isabel and Virgie
concluded. For it seemed that all the funny contests ever staged in
parlors or at picnics were presented in some amusing way. From
marshmallow to hurdle races the selections were entertaining to both
contestants and audience. The girls who were to take part had been
selected beforehand by the athletic director, that little matters like
age and size might seem appropriate to the part taken. No one refused to
try the feat demanded, and when the councillors were ordered to perform,
the merriment grew.</p>
<p>One easy-going, plump little camper created some amusement in the “bean
race”. “Hurry up,” called one of the older girls, “you haven’t a single
one of your beans carried over yet and everybody else has!”</p>
<p>“I can’t help it,” returned the little girl placidly, working away
quietly at the pile of beans on the floor, “they won’t get on my knife.”</p>
<p>But patience and perserverance won. Not nervous about anything, when the
beans did “get on her knife”, she carried them without spilling to their
destined place and was the first to have her bean supply all accounted
for.</p>
<p>The “shot-put” was contested by girls and councillors with big balloons,
the line men soberly measuring the distances. Grins were measured. A one
hundred-yard dash proved to be walking on a string (stretched from one
point to another) with stepping off, and watching the string and one’s
footsteps through a field glass held reversed. But the contest which
aroused the most enthusiasm and the wildest excitement was one called a
relay race, in which the choice of girls had much to do with the
amusement. Four on a side, they stood at opposite walls of the dining
hall, and were numbered in order. The plan was simple enough, merely to
open a suit-case, which was placed by Number One of each side, don the
dress, hat and coat which were found inside, open an umbrella, and walk
over to the opposite side. There the clothing would be returned to the
suit-case, the umbrella closed, the quick return made and all handed to
Number Two, who continued the performance. Dimple Dot, the quiet,
dignified Cathalina, cultured Marion, fat May and determined Virgie were
of this company. The side through first would win, hence the mad
scramble which brought tears to the eyes of the laughing girls. Isabel,
through the megaphone, gave the same order which she had given for the
other races, though perhaps not entirely appropriate here. “Ready,—on
your mark—all set—go!”</p>
<p>Cathalina threw dignity to the winds and was especially deft in the
whole performance. Little Dot was almost swallowed up in the bungalow
apron which did duty as dress, and presented a comical figure as she ran
across the floor, stepping on her long draperies, lost in the big hat
and coat, and swallowed up in the umbrella. “I guess Cathalina and
Marion never hurried like that in their lives before,” she gasped, as
she sank on the floor after taking off her garb and returning it to the
suit-case. She had won the race for her side, for May was not quite
through.</p>
<p>The line up for prizes was made a matter of much dignity, as pieces of
candy, popcorn crisps or cookies were presented to the winners. Then the
girls helped place the tables and chairs in order for the noon meal
which was almost ready.</p>
<p>In the afternoon there came more rain and heavier. Puddles stood in the
grass. Little streams ran down the paths and joined in larger ones.
Water poured from the dining hall roof and beat a tattoo upon the
umbrellas of the returning girls, for again entertainment was planned
with the big hall as headquarters. This time the good old-fashioned
games were used. And there were some little city girls that had not
played “drop the handkerchief”! The “farmer in the dell” was kept going
for some time. Musical chairs was played without chairs, girls in a line
crooking right and left arms alternately to be grasped when the music
stopped by the girls who marched around them. London Bridge was called
for, and the question asked by the leaders was, “Which would you rather
be, the best swimmer in camp, or the best tennis player?” Girls in the
line passing under the bridge wondered why Frances had so many behind
her, till their turn came to hear the question. Lilian, Cathalina and
some others took their places behind Marion in favor of tennis, but most
of the girls desired to excel in swimming, and their long line easily
won in the tug of war which followed.</p>
<p>“O, look, girls, the sun!”</p>
<p>While they were absorbed in the games it had stopped raining. The bell
by the club house rang and the athletic director announced swimming.
“Into your bathing suits,” she cried, “and don’t forget to gather up
your rain coats and other things to take with you!”</p>
<p>“We’ll not get wet after all, Izzy,” said Virgie, teasing, as they
paddled down from their klondikes to the shore through puddles, sand and
mud. “Do you dare me to do a somersault and dive from the high board?”</p>
<p>“What is the use of daring? You’ll do it anyhow if you feel like it. I
am practicing on the ‘crawl’ stroke, but it is so easy to drop into the
one you are used to using. Doesn’t Cathalina look sweet with that pretty
cape or cloak to match her suit? Here’s for the rolling deep!”—with
which Isabel threw herself from the dock into deep water, came up to
breathe and shake the water from her rosy face, and made for the float,
from which she and Virginia expected to dive. Even the girls who had not
been swimmers were growing accustomed to the watery element, gaining
both in confidence and ability.</p>
<p>“The bell will ring for a boat ride at four o’clock,” was the
announcement after the whistle blew for all to come out of the water.
“Come now, everybody out! Go up and get thoroughly dry and take sweaters
for the trip.”</p>
<p>By the time the Aeolus had started with its happy company, a fresh
breeze and bright sun were already drying off the walks and grass. It
seemed a different world. The blue water was dancing and the tide
favorable to their ride up Merrymeeting Bay. Past “Marshmallow Point”,
past the swimming cove, past gulls posing on fishing weirs, the Aeolus
glided.</p>
<p>“There’s the hunters’ cabin, Hilary. See how it looks from the bay.”</p>
<p>“Not very far from shore, June; suppose the old pirate sank his treasure
chest with chain and anchor?”</p>
<p>“What if he had!”</p>
<p>“Six grey stones at the water’s edge,” repeated Hilary in a sepulchral
tone.</p>
<p>“Now Hilary, don’t laugh! Honest, don’t you think he could have done
it?”</p>
<p>“How should I know?”</p>
<p>“O, Hilary, I think you’re mean.”</p>
<p>“Because I don’t add my imagination to yours?”</p>
<p>“Look, girls,” said Rhoda as they turned to come back. “There comes the
Virginian. We’ll get her waves. Don’t you just love to go up and down?”</p>
<p>“That is nothing to what we shall do in the deep sea fishing next week,”
said Marjorie. “They say we go ’way out and anchor, and bob up and down
while we pull in the monsters of the deep!”</p>
<p>The Virginia saluted the Aeolus with three long blasts, and Aeolus not
to be outdone in courtesy returned the salute through a long tin horn,
while the girls called “Rah, rah, Virginian!”</p>

<p>“O, Lil-i-an!”</p>
<p>“Lilian’s out on the point working on a song.”</p>
<p>“Words and tune too?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, very likely. She has her guitar with her and told us that
she was not to be disturbed ‘on pain of death’. But she laughed when she
said it, and if you want to see her, go and hunt her up.”</p>
<p>“Imagine Lil’s going off alone!”</p>
<p>“First she and Cathalina were working on a Merrymeeting song, then we
all got at it and evolved one of a sort. O, it’s a rouser, <i>mihi
crede</i>!” and Betty waved both hands, as if directing some Merrymeeting
celebration.</p>
<p>“What’s ‘meehee craydeh’?” asked Virgie.</p>
<p>“‘Believe me’; you find it in Cicero, though he did not use it in a
slangy way, of course. At least I suppose not, in his famous orations.
You ought to take Latin, Virgie. It would be lots of fun now, because
you would have it to Patty. Dr. Carver wouldn’t have the beginning Latin
classes last year, so Patty took them. <i>We</i> had it to Dr. Carver, alas.
Here comes Lilian now. Did you get ‘lonse’ all by yourself, Lil?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and the divine afflatus wouldn’t afflate. I guess it works better
when you’re all round. I thought if anything would bring the Muse it
would be the ashes of the camp fires and the thoughts of the Indians
that used to meet there. I just had a little idea, but not of a regular
Merrymeeting song.”</p>
<p>“Did you know that the people on some of the land here first got their
deed, or whatever it was, back in 1726?”</p>
<p>“My, they must be old!”</p>
<p>“O, you know what I mean, their ancestors, of course.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve been inquiring about all the legends and stories of this
place. This used to be heavily wooded, all over the point, and they used
to come down and shoot bears, right where this camp is. Dear me, when
you get into New England you are where things have happened!”</p>
<p>“Yes, and in the West, too,” reminded loyal Virginia. “We have wild
Injun stories there, too, if we haven’t any Captain Kidd.”</p>
<p>“That is what my verses are about, Captain Kidd, If I finish them I may
hand them in, though the prize will be for some regular Merrymeeting
song, in praise of Merrymeeting, you know, something that will go with
yells and celebrations. At least that is what I should think would take
the prize, what I would give it for if I were on the committee of
councillors. But when I get something into my head I have to finish it,
or try to.”</p>
<p>“I’ll help you, Lilian—I’ll make up all the first lines of the couplets
and you make the second lines, or whatever lines have to have the
rhyme.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you generous, Virgie!”</p>
<p>“Who’s going to claim the prize if the song you all wrote together wins
it?” asked Virginia.</p>
<p>“We haven’t thought that up yet,” replied Betty.</p>
<p>Not long after this conversation the songs were called for and a meeting
appointed at the club house to try out the songs previous to the awards
by the committee. The songs were to be sung before the assembled
campers, preferably by the composer, if not, by the young councillor in
charge of the proceedings. Another councillor was at the piano. This
method was explained at the beginning.</p>
<p>“There was an unusually large number of songs handed in this year, which
is very gratifying to the committee, but will make the choice more
difficult. As far as possible the author of the verses, or the klondike,
if part or all of the girls have learned them, will sing them here
tonight. First we shall have the Laugh-a-lot songs.”</p>
<p>Most of these were short efforts, but raised a great deal of applause
for the composers, though the term author is more appropriate, since the
songs were set to popular or familiar tunes. One small author sat on a
councillor’s lap and was so overcome when her pretty little song was
sung that she turned her face away; and at the vociferous applause which
followed, she quite hid her head on the protecting shoulder.</p>
<p>One of the Intermediates in Piggly-Wiggly sang all alone, in a gentle
voice, two pretty verses about river, bay, island and clouds. Helen,
Eloise and the rest of the girls in that senior cabin gave praise to
Merrymeeting in a rousing chorus set to Yankee Doodle. Lilian, Cathalina
and Betty did the singing for Squirrels’ Inn. Lilian had decided not to
offer her Captain Kidd verses, declaring that there were too many active
things to do at camp to bother about a “masterpiece”. Then, too, it
would not turn out to be a real Merrymeeting song.</p>
<p>After the singing of the list, a few which were easily recognized as the
best were asked for again, and the committee promised as quick a
decision as possible. As it turned out, several songs were adopted as
Merrymeeting songs, and several prizes were given, one to Squirrels’ Inn
included.</p>
<p>June, Jo and Dot came around to ask Lilian what had become of the
Captain Kidd song.</p>
<p>“Why, where did you ever hear that I was writing one?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I heard you and Hilary talking about it one time,” replied June.</p>
<p>“It isn’t much,”</p>
<p>“We want to hear it any way.”</p>
<p>“I’ll send it to the <i>Moon</i> and if they accept it you shall hear it read
there.”</p>
<p>“All right. Did you hear any more facts about Captain Kidd?”</p>
<p>Lilian laughed. “I don’t know that I have any ‘facts’ about him, but I
find that there is a story about the real Captain Kidd and the Kennebec.
It is said that he used to attack boats that came to this trading
center, kill off everybody but one, whom he left to help him carry the
goods to his hiding place, and then kill him too. Nice old pirate! And
they say that the name ‘Merrymeeting’ applied not only to the five
rivers beside the Kennebec that come into Merrymeeting Bay, but to the
meeting of the tribes here.”</p>
<p>“Then the boys’ stories were true, or at least some of them!” said June
with satisfaction.</p>
<p>“How can you be glad that such terrible things happened,” teased Lilian.</p>
<p>“O, I wouldn’t have had ’em happen,” explained June carefully, “but if
they did happen I want to know about it, and it would be great if we
could find some treasure. Miss Patty, do you know where we could get
something to dig with?”</p>
<p>“No, June, and remember, kiddies, that you can’t dig up the place,—it
isn’t yours. And if you ever go to the hunters’ cabin, Hilary and some
of the big girls must go with you.”</p>
<p>“O, dear, then we can’t have any fun, I suppose, and if we did find
anything it wouldn’t belong to us anyway!”</p>
<p>“Finders keepers,” suggested Dot.</p>
<p>“That wouldn’t be honest, I’m afraid,” said June.</p>
<p>“That ethical point can be decided if you ever come across any treasure.
I’m sure that you would be amply rewarded! Have fun thinking about it
anyhow.”</p>
<p>“S’pose we’d find some big red rubies,” suggested Jo.</p>
<p>“And di’monds,” added Dot.</p>
<p>“And pearls,” said June. “Haven’t we got the imaginations though? Say,
Lilian, please read us the verses!”</p>
<p>“O, all right, I had fun, too, writing out the story.”</p>

</div>
<p>“Hurry! Don’t let the youngsters see you Campbell. They went out the
lane a while ago with ‘Mother Nature’ and may be back at any time. I
think they went after flowers and will not go through the woods to the
shore, I’m pretty sure.”</p>
<p>“We’ll just go right down to the pine grove, and if they see us we can’t
do it, that’s all.”</p>
<p>Campbell had come up before supper with several parents and some boys
from Boothbay, and had just come in from canoeing with Hilary. They were
laughing, as they walked up from the shore and beckoned to Cathalina,
Betty and Eloise, who happened to appear. While Campbell unfolded a
little plan, they stood in a smiling group, approving the scheme, which
developed further under the ideas of more conspirators. Campbell fished
in his pocket for something which they all examined with interest.
Cathalina thought a moment, and with one word, “wait”, sped away toward
her cabin. There she searched her trunk for a few minutes and flew back
to her companions.</p>
<p>“Just the thing! Don’t you want them, Cathalina?”</p>
<p>“No, I happened to bring them because they were in with the rest.”</p>
<p>As if strolling, the party moved toward the pine grove, but when they
had reached its shelter their demeanor changed and they scurried along
the trail, through the trees and over the rocks that lined the shore of
Merrymeeting Bay.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to be quick,” said Campbell, “before my party has to leave.”</p>
<p>“Where shall we put it?”</p>
<p>“Look; just the place!”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid they’ll think it’s fishy.”</p>
<p>“Let ’em; they’ll soon find out, anyhow.”</p>
<p>“O, Campbell, have more imagination.”</p>
<p>“They will like it in the end. Let me know how it comes out, girls.”</p>
<p>“Indeed we will.”</p>
<p>“Be sure to have them start out early tomorrow morning before anybody
else does.”</p>
<p>As they came back toward the club house, they saw June, Dot and Jo
sitting on the steps, talking earnestly and mysteriously, as gestures
and looks indicated.</p>
<p>“Hello, June,” called Campbell, holding out a hand. “And how are Dot and
Jo by this time?” June sprang to meet him, Dot took his other hand and
Jo stood smiling by.</p>
<p>“Where’ve you been, Mr. Stuart?” asked Dot. “We looked for you after
supper.”</p>
<p>“Just now we’ve come from the pine grove and around the rocks,” replied
Campbell, promptly and truthfully. “Big storm last night, girls, must
have beat upon the rocks something fierce! I wonder if it opened up any
of the caves where Captain Kidd’s treasure is!”</p>
<p>“Campbell!” exclaimed Hilary, laughing.</p>
<p>“We’ll go up tomorrow and see,” said Jo, entering into the spirit of
Campbell’s joking. “But we children are not allowed to play around there
alone. I don’t see why, because there’s nobody ever there but camp
folks.”</p>
<p>“Could the big girls take you? They could get up early for once,
couldn’t they?”</p>
<p>“Why, Mr. Stuart! You know we get up as early as the boys do, and have a
dip and everything, early bird hikes,—”</p>
<p>“Of course you do, Jo, excuse me!”</p>
<p>“We’ll prove it,” said Cathalina. “We will take you tomorrow morning. Be
ready and we’ll stop for you,—we’ll whistle Campbell’s fraternity
whistle.”</p>
<p>“All right! Goody!” The little girls jumped up and down as small girls
sometimes do.</p>
<p>“Hunting treasure!” exclaimed Campbell. “What could be more thrilling?”</p>
<p>“Wear your sweaters, kiddies,” Hilary admonished, “it will be cool.”</p>
<p>“What time shall we get up?”</p>
<p>“About six o’clock?”</p>
<p>“O, that isn’t early enough. That would only give us an hour or so
before dip.”</p>
<p>“Mercy,” said Eloise, “how long do you want?”</p>
<p>“Could you come for us at five or five-thirty, before <i>anybody</i> is up,
you know?”</p>
<p>“I guess so,” said Hilary.</p>
<p>Bright and early the next morning, Cathalina and Hilary whistled softly
outside of Laugh-a-lot and were joined by three stealthily moving
figures which slipped out of the klondike, permission having been asked
the night before.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this fun?” said Betty. “What if we really should find something?”</p>
<p>Little birds disturbed in their slumbers twittered a little from the
trees as the girls passed. Jo had a spade, which she had secured soon
after the conversation with Campbell. June had a trowel, and Dot carried
a stout stick, which she had sharpened.</p>
<p>“We had the awfullest time doing anything to get ready last night,
because the girls asked what we were doing.”</p>
<p>Arrived at the cabin, the little girls peered eagerly around and the big
girls pretended to do so. The hunter’s cabin itself was of no particular
interest, because of having been explored before. They did not consider
taking up the floor to dig or doing anything to injure property that
belonged to other people. “O, don’t I wish I owned this place,” sighed
Dot. “I’d dig and dig whenever I needed exercise!”</p>
<p>“There’s an awfully old looking pine tree, Dot,” said Jo, “and not far
from that ledge either.” To the older girls’ great amusement, Dot
brought forth a ruler, which they had not noticed before.</p>
<p>“They are actually going to measure according to that silly verse,”
whispered Cathalina.</p>
<p>As if to explain the performance to more critical judgment, June said,
“Now I don’t suppose that there is anything in that verse, but if we are
going to dig at all we may as well have some plan.”</p>
<p>“O, what’s this?” cried Jo, turning up something near the pine tree from
which they were about to measure. The three little girls dropped on
their knees as Jo pried up from the ground an old-fashioned brooch set
with a small garnet. It was well packed with dirt and took some cleaning
and blowing on Jo’s part to make it apparent what jewel it contained. It
was, however, remarkable, considering how long the pin must have been
there if dropped by Captain Kidd, how little spoiled it was by wind and
weather. The little girls looked soberly at each other and began to
examine the place.</p>
<p>The next find was made by Dot and was a little silver coin, too worn for
any marks of identification to be distinguished. This time the older
girls sat down on the ground to examine it. “See how crusty it is with
dirt!” exclaimed June excitedly. She was sitting at the foot of one of
the larger trees and lifted a little mat of pine needles where the
curving root showed a little hollow.</p>
<p>“O, look here, I feel something hard!” Slipping her hand down further,
she fished out a queer-looking metal case of some sort, all battered and
dingy, encrusted with dirt and rattling with its contents as June held
it up. “H’m,” said she, “I guess it looks old enough for Captain Kidd’s
time, or maybe the Indians put it there, or some hunter. Beads or
pearls, which?”</p>
<p>The girls had quite a time in getting off the cover, which was at one
end, but finally it flew off.</p>
<p>“Just beads.”</p>
<p>“Probably for Indians.”</p>
<p>“Take ’em out and see what’s underneath.”</p>
<p>“Empty the whole thing out into your lap!”</p>
<p>The last bit of advice was followed, and there came tumbling out of the
funny old long case a stringy little mass of beads and jewelry. This
they began to disentangle at once.</p>
<p>“Here’s a coral necklace.”</p>
<p>“Look at this little gold cross with a weeny ruby, but one arm is broken
off! Too bad.”</p>
<p>A silver buckle of old style, a plain gold pin, a pair of long jet
earrings, a delicate gold chain with a tiny heart on it, a small ring
set with a real turquoise and another set with a garnet and pearls
completed the list. June looked quizzically at Cathalina. “Seems to me
I’ve seen that gold chain and heart before. I bet you and Campbell put
this box here last night!”</p>
<p>“What makes you think so?” parried Cathalina.</p>
<p>“I just do. Didn’t you wear that chain at our first party?”</p>
<p>“How could I if it were here?”</p>
<p>“O, but it wasn’t here. You dear old Cathalina, you didn’t want us to be
disappointed, did you?” It was like June to take it so, instead of
feeling that the girls and Campbell wanted to make fun of the little
girls.</p>
<p>Dot and Jo were looking a bit rueful and Dot remarked dolefully, “Of
course we can’t keep ’em, then,” and turned the turquoise ring about on
her finger.</p>
<p>“Of course you can keep them if you like them. We thought that you’d
like to find something, and of course you can’t dig around much to spoil
the looks of things here.”</p>
<p>“Well,” said philosophical June, “of course we’d like to find some real
Captain Kidd stuff, but after all, Dot, it’s better to have these pretty
things than to dig around and not find a thing.”</p>
<p>“That’s so,” replied Dot, looking more cheerful. “Let’s divide them, if
Cathalina really meant them for us. Why don’t you want them, Cathalina?”</p>
<p>“I never wear them. O, I did put on that necklace once lately. I had
forgotten it. Mother gave me quite a lot of old jewelry one day, saying
that no one ever wore the pieces and that I might keep them or give them
away, as I liked. I happened to have it with me and thought of it when
Campbell said ‘let’s fix up something for the girls to find.’ The
turquoise ring I had when I was about Dot’s age, and I thought of that
for her, of the garnet one for Jo, and of the little chain for June. But
divide them any way you like.”</p>
<p>“My, you’re good to us, Cathalina,” said Dot.</p>
<p>The children had quite a lively time while dividing the “treasure”. They
decided to keep it a secret about the digging, and asked the older girls
not to tell. “We didn’t put that coin there, though,” said Hilary.</p>
<p>“That’s so!” exclaimed Dot. “We did find something, then!”</p>

</div>
<p style='text-indent:0'><span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Dearest Polly and Juliet:</span></p>
<p>You can’t imagine how we girls enjoyed your combination letter in reply
to the little card we sent,—just to tell you where we were and to let
you know that we are thinking of you. It is fine, Polly, that Juliet is
with you on the ranch this summer. Maybe she will look like more than
your “shadow” by the time she leaves the ranch. In my “mind’s eye” I see
you both tearing around on horseback,—or is it bronco-back?</p>
<p>We appreciate all the more your writing to us because you have been so
busy with the summer’s work. We all went out on the rocks, Patty, too,
and sat there eating blueberries while Cathalina read the letter to us.
You have already received her letter, of course. She said that she tried
to give you a general idea of the camp and told you about some of the
good times we’ve had, and they have been going on steadily since. It
would take pages and pages to tell about them.</p>
<p>The August tournaments are on now. We have been playing off tennis and
trying hard to have our team win in the other games. Since Cathalina
wrote, we have had some fine trips, too. One was our second trip to
Popham Beach for surf bathing. That was the real salt water, you know,
sandy beach and everything. The water was cold, but you feel so fine,
all in a glow afterwards. Those big waves,—I just love them. There is a
place to buy ice-cream and other things, and we are always hungry, you
know. We go to a house not far from the beach to change to bathing
suits, and after the swim we have a hot lunch on the shore, hot beans
and bacon or “wieners” and sandwiches, pickles, cake, different good
things, and my, how we eat! This last time it took a good while to eat
our lunch and then we shopped a little in Bay Point, which is the name
of the little town, and all this made us late starting home. It is a
three hours’ ride, anyway, and you may imagine that we were late getting
home, and hungry again. We had to stop at Bath for errands and to pick
up a visitor who was coming up to camp, then had to “buck tide” all the
way up. The smaller boat got in while the folks were eating supper, but
our big boat was heavier, with more passengers, couldn’t get through the
Burnt Jackets and went around the longer way. The folks saw us turn
around and go back and were worried, I guess, for one of the other boats
came to meet us, but developed engine trouble and we beat it home! The
girls pretended to be starving, and went up the rise to the dining-room
saying, “We want food! We want food!” and two or three of the
councillors who came out to meet us answered, “We want our children! We
want our children!”</p>
<p>As we have been having good weather right along, it was decided to have
the deep sea fishing trip this week, too. We go to the same beach, but
go out to sea and fish. Last year they had rough weather and some of the
girls had a hard time to stand it, after they anchored and were tossed
around and up and down and back and forth! But this time it wasn’t rough
at all. O, we rode some nice big waves, but that was fun. Our two boats
caught forty fish. We had so much fun through it all. Evelyn Calvert
caught the biggest fish of all and was so excited and even scared over
it. Eloise and Helen are a “perfect scream” when they are together, say
the funniest things with the most sober faces, and keep us laughing half
the time. We have met so many interesting girls up here, too, besides
the Greycliffers. Frances Anderson is a peach and Marion Thurman is a
dear,—but Cathalina said that she told you all about Squirrels’ Inn.
Virgie is having a great time with Isabel, who keeps her down somewhat.
Can you imagine Isabel’s keeping anybody down? Virginia is all right,
but after being bottled up so long she sometimes wants to try all sorts
of things. I heard Isabel telling her the other day that she wanted to
get back to school alive anyhow.</p>
<p>O, I must tell you about the scare we had. You know how noises do sound
in the night. At first whenever a squirrel would run over the roof
somebody would squeal, but we are used to that now. Once a mouse ran
around the big room, and must have been scared to death, I judge, when
we all jumped up on our cots and shrieked. Anyway we did not see him
again.</p>
<p>This time it was moonlight and we were all asleep, our shutters opened
as usual, the big doors “bolted and barred”. The windows are all
screened and rather high from the ground. Cathalina sleeps just across
from me, and when I suddenly woke up that night I saw her sitting up in
bed, rubbing her eyes and looking startled. “What was that?” she
whispered over to me. We listened and heard the bushes rustle and
crackle and it seemed as if a stone rolled down the bank. Then we
imagined that some one was coming up the steps in front. By this time
nearly all the girls were sitting up to listen, and Patty woke up too.</p>
<p>“What are you all awake for, girls?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Just listen,” several of us whispered, and put our fingers on our lips
to warn her. Just then came a terrible bump on the door. Marion screamed
and ducked down in bed. Cathalina flew over to Lilian, whose cot is not
far from hers. Patty jumped up as if she were shot, and went toward the
door, putting on her bath robe, while Hilary picked up a baseball bat
that was standing in a corner and joined Patty. She tried to laugh, and
said, “I will protect you or perish, Miss West,” but I’m sure her teeth
were chattering.</p>
<p>“Sh-sh,” said Patty.</p>
<p>Next we all flew to our windows and looked out. They’re screened tight,
so we couldn’t lean out. Not a thing could we see but moonlight on the
bushes and trees.</p>
<p>“Open the back door and look, girls,” said somebody. “Not on your life,”
said Nora.</p>
<p>“Nobody could get up there.”</p>
<p>“Yes they could; they could climb!”</p>
<p>“Somebody go to the club house!”</p>
<p>“Yes, and get murdered on the way!”</p>
<p>“I wonder if it could be a bear.”</p>
<p>“No bears here now.”</p>
<p>“Get your revolver, Hilary.”</p>
<p>“Haven’t got any.”</p>
<p>“Sh-sh. I just said that for the benefit of the burglar.”</p>
<p>“Could it be the boys trying to scare us?”</p>
<p>“They wouldn’t do such a thing, besides they couldn’t get up here
without being found out.”</p>
<p>By this time it began to be a lark to some of us, and we got over being
so frightened. Then there was a rubbing sound against the klondike.
Patty was puzzled, we could see, but she said, “I think that it must be
some animal, probably a loose horse.” Then she told us to keep still so
she could listen, and we all got scared again. Lilian whispered that she
heard breathing, and when Nora said, “Course you do, it’s me,” everybody
laughed.</p>
<p>Patty began to get tired of our nonsense and said, “Girls! No burglar
would try to get in here after all that shrieking! It is a wonder that
the people at the club house haven’t been roused before this!”</p>
<p>Just then somebody did run up the steps and knocked on the door. A most
welcome voice called, “What’s the matter, girls?” Patty unfastened the
door in a jiffy and there were the councillor and one of the girls from
the nearest cabin. They had heard the commotion and finally decided to
come over. Patty told them, and the girls just stood aside and pointed
at two stray cows that by this time were some little distance away, over
where the bushes grow thickly at the top of the bank.</p>
<p>We all settled down then and went to sleep after a while, but we nearly
collapsed with merriment the next morning going over it again,—the way
the girls looked and what they said and how ridiculous it all was! One
would remember one thing that was said and another something else, till
Patty said that we might “use the occurrence” in a “stunt” if we chose.
Maybe we shall, but there was another cow episode that was a little more
wildly exciting, perhaps, when we were on a six point hike from North
Bath, through the woods on the mainland opposite. One of the girls threw
some sticks as they passed some cows, and the cows chased them. They
were not “dumb driven cattle,” by any means! Even Virgie, who is used to
cows, climbed a tree, and we have teased Isabel nearly to death for
getting on a big rock and asking Virgie in anguished tones if cows could
climb rocks. Virgie said, “Yes,” as she was climbing the tree, and
Isabel did not know what to do; but the cows went past. They were fierce
looking things, had long horns. Now you would have lassoed a few,
wouldn’t you?</p>
<p>There is so much to tell that it would take volumes if I tried to write
it. But when we get back to school we can have a good old visit and tell
all we know and some that we don’t know, as usual. I do hope that you
both will be there. You did not say a word about school in your letter.
However, the ranch doings were of more interest to us all just now. All
the girls send heaps of love to you both. We hope to see you at the
opening of school.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXI</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>A FIVE-POINT HIKE</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>“There goes the bell. Are you going, Hilary?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Frances. I’m awfully sleepy, and it is hot this
afternoon.”</p>
<p>“Good breeze, though.”</p>
<p>“Do we get points for this hike?”</p>
<p>“Five miles, five points.”</p>
<p>“All right, Frances, I’ll try to get up a little energy and go! How
about you, Lilian?”</p>
<p>“Why you know I twisted my ankle a little this morning in games and it
doesn’t feel right yet. I’ve been rubbing it, but I do not believe that
a five-mile walk would help it any.”</p>
<p>“O, no; you ought to rest it today. Did you see the nurse?”</p>
<p>“No, it did not swell or anything. I just gave it a wrench, I guess. It
will be all right.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going either,” said Cathalina. “I will go down to the house and
get you some liniment, if you like.”</p>
<p>Marion, Frances and Hilary proved to be the only Squirrels’ Inn
representatives on this hike, for Betty decided to stay with Lilian and
Cathalina, and Nora had other plans. The three hikers donned their
elkskin hiking shoes, took their smallest purses and started with the
rest out the road toward First Trott’s. It was too early in the
afternoon for much shade, though the narrow road wound between ferns and
woods as ever. The sun had baked the ruts hard, too, and came down hot
upon youthful shoulders. But why get points if one does not earn them by
effort?</p>
<p>“I’m going to see how soon I can walk it,” said one girl, striding past,
though for the most part the girls were going in groups, some strolling,
some walking briskly or sturdily along.</p>
<p>“Goodbye, then,” said Frances, “there isn’t any hurry this time, with
such a short hike and time to rest there. I’d rather take it more slowly
and eat a few blueberries or stop in the shade occasionally, wouldn’t
you, Hilary?”</p>
<p>“Indeed I would. But I didn’t bring my field glasses. I thought that
there would be few birds flying while it is so hot, and we’ll be coming
home for supper before it cools off very much.”</p>
<p>“How far is it to Second Trott’s?” asked Marion.</p>
<p>“Opinions differ, but on our hikes it is always considered a five-mile
hike there and back, or to the school-house, which is not far beyond.
What sort of a performance, by the way, are they going to have there? Do
either of you know what we are going to do?”</p>
<p>“Why, yes, Frances,” replied Hilary. “They said it was a lawn fete, or
something of the sort, and that we could buy ice cream and candy and
lemonade, maybe other things.”</p>
<p>“I wonder if they will not let the boys come up, too,” said Marion.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised to see them,” Frances assented.</p>
<p>Hilary had not thought of that, but her mind immediately visualized a
certain young councillor whom she would be very glad to see.</p>
<p>Soon they reached the turn in the road after Second Trott’s. With a
gentle rise it wound around some fine old rocks, on whose top grew great
pine trees. In these a little flock of chickadees was turning
somersaults. Further on was a bit of backwater, near which grew some
water plants, and a line of brilliant cardinal flowers. Climbing along
steep and dusty hill, the girls found themselves in sight of the white
school house, known as Chopp’s. There, indeed, was a group of Boothbay
boys, some just arriving as the Merrymeeting campers came up. They had
come by a different way, upstream from Boothbay Camp, then docking at
the mainland, on the opposite side of the back water, which makes a
peninsula out of Merrymeeting.</p>
<p>The first thing was to cool off a little and enjoy ice cream and other
goodies afforded by the ladies who served the refreshments. Home-made
cake, candy and nuts proved popular. The lemonade, alas, was all gone
before the Merrymeeting girls arrived, but there was plenty of cool
water. Campbell was looking for Hilary, afraid that perhaps she was not
coming, and walked to meet the girls, as they approached. “Where’s
Cathalina?” he asked.</p>
<p>“She and Betty stayed with Lilian. Lil twisted her ankle this morning,
not much, but enough to keep her from any long hike. I promised to bring
her some sweets.”</p>
<p>“Well, come on, girls, before everything is gone, and I’ll see that you
get some ice cream and cake.”</p>
<p>Campbell beckoned to another councillor and they waited upon the girls,
bringing the cooling water, which tasted so good after the hot walk, and
the more substantial refreshments, as they could be waited upon.</p>
<p>“O, you don’t know how good this is!” exclaimed Hilary.</p>
<p>“Yes I do, for I thought I never was so thirsty in my life and we did
not have much of a walk. But Bob and I came up in a canoe and it was hot
on the water.”</p>
<p>“I always get sunburned till I peel off, on a canoe trip,” said Frances.</p>
<p>“That remark is somewhat ambiguous, Frances.”</p>
<p>“All right, Marion, I’ll change it. On a canoe trip I always get
sunburned till I peel off later. My nose, arms and shoulders will have
an entirely different epidermis when I return from the wilds of Maine.
My, don’t I hate to think of it!”</p>
<p>“I would,” said Hilary, “if I were not going to such a wonderful school.
It is on the water, too, and while we do not have time for the good
times of a camp, not straight along, you know, we do some very
interesting things and I am going to try to get more of them in the next
year. My schedule will not be so full, and while I want to get in all
the studying that I can, and there are so many fine courses to take, I
suppose it is silly not to get some of the <i>different</i> things that you
never can get anywhere out of school.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to keep on at Greycliff instead of going to a regular
college?” asked Campbell.</p>
<p>“I am for this year, but I am not sure about the next. When I started to
Greycliff I expected to finish two years there instead of high school.
But you know they have two years of college work, too, and most of our
little crowd decided last year to return another year anyway.”</p>
<p>“It isn’t such a bad idea to miss the freshman year at college anyhow,”
said Campbell. “It is the hardest year.”</p>
<p>“Yes, and one will miss a lot of the hazing, but girls don’t make it as
bad as the boys do, and I suppose I’ll get to be as fond of college or
university life as I am of dear old Greycliff, though that does not seem
possible.”</p>
<p>“What sort of a school are you going to, one of the girls’ colleges or a
co-educational school?”</p>
<p>“That isn’t decided yet. It depends on what Father thinks about it. He
and Mother are still discussing it, and Mother says that Father has to
decide the matter. I have such wonderful parents that I am sure what
they decide will be just the thing.”</p>
<p>By this time the other councillor from Boothbay, with Frances and
Marion, had strolled out to where some games had been started, leaving
Campbell and Hilary still talking over their ice cream.</p>
<p>“I’m going West on a short trip with Uncle Mart at Christmas time,
Hilary. Would you mind if I stopped off to see you, or will you be at
home?”</p>
<p>“Would I <i>mind</i>!” exclaimed Hilary. “Why, Campbell, I’d love to have you
come. No, after having been away nearly all summer, I shall plan to stay
with the folks at Christmas time. And Father and Mother have been just
aching to have you and Philip and some of the rest come to be
entertained at our house,—ever since they have listened to my
description of the Stuarts and Van Buskirks, and all the sisters,
cousins and aunts that you have. We have so few near relatives.”</p>
<p>Campbell was wishing that Hilary would not be quite so general in her
expressions of interest in the Van Buskirks and Stuarts, but could not
but be satisfied with the heartiness of her response to his suggestion
of a visit at Christmas time. Hilary was no coquette, but it was a
source of her attraction, so far as Campbell was concerned, that he
could trust her sincerity. The fact that Hilary was interested in real
living more than many of the city girls whom Campbell knew was another
source of interest to him. “Hilary talks sense,” Campbell had remarked
to Philip. “She likes a good time as well as anybody, but that isn’t the
main thing in life, as she sees it. It’s some fun to send candy or
flowers to a girl who will really appreciate it, and not pat herself on
the back and think ‘How sweet I must be to have the boys sending me
flowers!’” And Philip had thought of another girl of the same true sort
to whose winning he intended to devote himself.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll have it to look forward to, then,” said Campbell, in reply
to Hilary’s cordiality. “I shall write to find out if it is all right
when the time comes. You don’t mind not playing the games out there,” he
continued, waving his hand toward the boys and girls.</p>
<p>“No; I much prefer this,” acknowledged Hilary demurely.</p>
<p>“I have a fine plan, at least it will be fine for me if you consent, and
I came up in a canoe on purpose. Do you suppose you can get permission
to go back with me?”</p>
<p>“Why I believe I can.” For what were points for hiking to Hilary when an
invitation from Campbell was in question?</p>
<p>Patty was not there, but Hilary asked the camp mother if Mr. Stuart
might paddle her home, and permission was granted. Smiling, Hilary ran
back to Campbell, stopping a moment to tell Frances of her change of
plan. “She asked me if you would upset the canoe,” Hilary reported to
Campbell, as they started off briskly, “and I told her that you could do
anything!”</p>
<p>“That was rather a doubtful reply,” remarked Campbell.</p>
<p>“She understood all right, but looked at me so soberly, just as if she
were going to refuse, asked me if you were Cathalina’s cousin and all
sorts of things that she knew perfectly well, just to make me think that
perhaps I could not go, but I knew that she was doing it for fun.”</p>
<p>“Did the girls mind your going?”</p>
<p>“No. Frances was lovely, and said that she would tell Marion.”</p>
<p>Hatless and brown from the sun, a typical summer girl and boy, Hilary
and Campbell swung along the way to the shore where the canoe waited. It
was pleasant to be taken care of, Hilary thought, as Campbell did the
launching and most of the paddling, and told Hilary to “fold her hands
and look pretty”.</p>
<p>“How could I!” she exclaimed with a laugh.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to try,” returned Campbell with an approving glance. But
this was the nearest approach to sentiment that he made that summer.
“Where shall we go? Into the bay and up the Androscoggin a little way?”</p>
<p>“That will be fine,” Hilary assented. “We still have an hour or so,
haven’t we? We were only there about half an hour, I think. I didn’t
wear my watch, though.”</p>
<p>“I’ll get you home in time,” declared Campbell. “Let’s forget the time
o’ day and just have a good old talk.” This they proceeded to do, but
after all managed to arrive at Merrymeeting dock in time for Campbell to
join the Boothbay flotilla, which started from the other shore for
Boothbay Camp.</p>
<p>“Goodbye, Campbell, I have had such a good time.”</p>
<p>“So have I, and I hope we can have a few more visits before camp
closes.”</p>
<p>The bell was ringing for swimming, for which there was just time enough
before supper. Hilary met the girls coming down to the shore as she went
up to get her bathing suit.</p>
<p>“Why from this direction?” asked Marjorie. “The last I saw of you, you
were eating ice cream at the school-house.”</p>
<p>“O, I came home in an aeroplane,” joked Hilary.</p>
<p>“She was paddled home,” explained Jean to Marjorie, as they ran past
Hilary.</p>
<p>Hilary found some of the girls of Squirrels’ Inn just getting ready for
the swim, and they all went in together. “This,” said Frances, as they
swam out to the float, “is the end of a perfect day for you, isn’t it,
Hilary?”</p>
<p>“I think I’ll have to acknowledge it,” said Hilary, turning over to
float a while, “but we are going to work a while on our canoe after
supper, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>“Yes, unless something else turns up.”</p>
<p>Much mystery was in the air relative to the decorating of canoes. Each
group of girls contesting had one in some sequestered spot and was
decking it for the annual canoe pageant. Prizes were to be given for the
prettiest and for the most original idea. Crepe paper had been brought
up in quantities and in all colors from Bath. Wire and string were in
great demand. Some of the girls were working hard on designs and
decorations. The little folks had great ambitions, but depended more on
their councillors to work out ideas. The older girls could do their own
decorating, with assistance at the last from the long-suffering man
power of the camp; for not a tack or wire was to be hammered into these
graceful and expensive canoes.</p>
<p>“I know what you’re going to have,” asserted Virgie to June.</p>
<p>“No you don’t; you just hope I’m going to tell you!”</p>
<p>“Yes I do, I guessed.”</p>
<p>“Who told you that you were right?”</p>
<p>“Nobody.”</p>
<p>“O, you just think that you can get me to tell you, Miss Virgie, but we
are going to have the funniest and best of all, I’m sure. Just wait till
tomorrow night!”</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>Lilian was trying on Eloise’s bathing suit of red and black, and
wrapping the cloak of the same colors about her, she folded her arms and
repeated, “Fifteen men on a dead man’s chest!”</p>
<p>“Yo! ho! ho! and a bottle of rum! Wait till I get on my fierce beard and
mustache and you’ll see what a pirate can look like!”</p>
<p>“What do you think of this?” asked Hilary, as she tried on a fiery
looking turban made of silk middy ties. “And look at the flag Patty has
made for us. Isn’t that a scary skull and cross-bones?”</p>
<p>“Yes indeed! Patty’s a peach,—O, ‘fifteen men on a dead man’s chest. Yo,
ho, ho!—and a bottle of rum!’”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you a case, Lilian North!” exclaimed Cathalina, who was resting
from her recent labors on the canoe, and lay on her cot watching the
girls.</p>
<p>“O, Captain Kidd, we’re glad, we’re glad you aren’t here now!” hummed
Lilian.</p>
<p>“Are you going to sing that?” asked Cathalina.</p>
<p>“O, no; if I have time I’ll make up something like, ‘I’m Captain Kidd,
the pirate bold, who sails the Kennebec,—’”</p>
<p>“My right arm helps ’em walk the plank,” added Hilary.</p>
<p>“And little do I reck!” finished Cathalina.</p>
<p>“Hurrah!” cried Lilian. “Poetry made while you wait by Squirrels’ Inn
and company. Give me another verse and I’ll take my guitar, neatly
concealed by evergreen, and make up a tune on two or three notes as we
go.”</p>
<p>“A verse is a line, Lilian.”</p>
<p>“Very well, a stanza, then. O bold and true, my pirate crew,—”</p>
<p>“And if they’re not, what then?” asked Frances.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Frances, that will make the next line. Ah, Davy Jones will get
their bones,—mm.”</p>
<p>“Goodbye, ye merry men! Tra-la, another poem for our collection of
masterpieces! Say it all, Hilary,” continued Cathalina.</p>
<p>Hilary, “struck an attitude” and with some prompting, repeated their
latest effort:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Most of the day had been spent by the campers upon the canoes, and in
some cases upon their own costumes, when these were necessary to carry
out the idea. It had been planned to use that witching time when the sky
was still beautiful from the sunset and yet the blue mist of evening
with moon and stars was just appearing in the east. It did not seem best
to plan for lighting up the canoes. While there was plenty of water, it
is true, to put out any blaze that might occur, the canoes might not be
in the most favorable position for an upset. The most beautiful light
was offered by Nature herself.</p>
<p>The girls had worked hard. Not a canoe but was prettily dressed. As each
one was brought from its hidden retreat to be launched, exclamations
were heard on all sides. Admiration and surprise were mingled. It was a
matter of honor not to intrude upon the secrecy of those engaged upon
the work, but in some way the news about a few had leaked out. However,
only the sight of the canoes themselves could give the full effect. The
athletic director and the other councillors knew the plans for the girls
and arranged the order of launching. With the heavier canoes, some of
which had a light framework wired and resting on top of the canoes, the
girls had to have some help. All those who were not needed to paddle or
pose stood upon the shore and dock as audience and judges.</p>
<p>In the graceful fleet which passed the “reviewing stand” there was the
canoe decked in ferns and evergreen, with a few paper birds wired to
poise in flight above; one in yellow and white, with yellow roses and
butterflies; another trimmed in white cotton, so put on as to imitate
snow and ice, a diamond dust covering all, two long-bearded,
white-garbed paddlers guiding the canoe, and a big white polar bear,
sitting in the center and carrying a banner marked “The Northland.” The
war canoe was given to some of the Juniors, who wanted to represent the
Old Woman who lived in a Shoe, and had to have several children to
overflow the big shoe of wired paper. One of the councillors in white
cap and kerchief took the part of the Old Woman, and the children in
quaint costumes, with ruffles of crepe paper, roused much enthusiasm
among the spectators.</p>
<p>This canoe won the prize for being the prettiest, and some of the judges
wanted to award it the prize for the most clever idea. But that finally
went to the three girls of Squirrels’ Inn, whose canoe was decked to
represent a pirate ship. A furled sail was put up in the bow, to which
the pirate flag was attached. Frances as Captain Kidd, with Lilian and
Hilary in costume, repeated in hoarse voices, as they passed the judges,
the couplet which Lilian had been chanting, with “Yo, ho, ho!—and a
bottle of rum!” Then all in deep voices sang the new Captain Kidd
stanzas to the tune of <i>Yankee Doodle</i>, rendered slowly, while Lilian
twanged an accompaniment on the guitar. Burnt cork mustaches of fierce
upward curve, made all this more impressive.</p>
<p>As the light grew more dim, the girls in the canoe marked the Northland,
turned on several flashlights, which lit up effectively the diamond
dust, and those in the pirate ship turned on several large ones, which
they had covered with their red paper. A few other lights flashed out in
different canoes as they all circled prettily in the water and came into
port once more.</p>
<p>“There, that’s over,” said Hilary, as with the pirate flag over one
shoulder and Lilian’s guitar over the other, she entered the klondike.
“Patty will certainly have to get up our entertainment for stunt night.
We have only about a week to get ready now, and with the Wiscasset hike,
the canoe trip to Brunswick, and the White Mountain trip, I can’t see
where we get up anything, do you Frances?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t. However, not all the girls will go on the White Mountain
trip, you know. Perhaps we can have some little easy part to do that we
can get quickly, or if we can think it up before we go, we can have it
in mind, you know.”</p>
<p>“There come Patty and the girls now; let’s ask them.”</p>
<p>“O, Miss Patty, how about our having stunt night next week?”</p>
<p>“I have been thinking about that, girls. Who has an idea?”</p>
<p>Nobody seemed to have one.</p>
<p>“They have had everything there is to have, I’m afraid,” said Lilian.</p>
<p>“Well, let me relieve your minds, then,” said Patricia. “I had an idea
several days ago and have been trying to get it a little more clearly
outlined.” At this point Cathalina gave a meaning nod to Lilian which
Patty caught. “Yes, you think ‘the poor English teacher,’ don’t you?”</p>
<p>“It reminded me of outlines,” Cathalina acknowledged.</p>
<p>“We must have a meeting tomorrow and I will tell you just what I think
we can do.”</p>
<p>At the morrow’s meeting the girls enthusiastically approved Miss West’s
idea, applauded the productions already in hand and thanked her warmly
for taking the responsibility. It was, to be sure, hers as councillor to
see that the girls had some sort of entertainment ready for their turn
at stunt night, but these girls, as good campers, were always willing to
do their share and had no desire to take advantage of their young
councillor. Some of the parts were given out and the girls began to
learn them. They considered it pure fun, for there was required no
serious preparation.</p>
<p>The canoe trip to Brunswick was next on the list of trips. The canoes,
stripped of their decorations, bore the jolly campers away, around
Marshmallow Point into Merrymeeting Bay, to the left, past Brick Island
of Captain Kidd fame, and on up the Androscoggin river, the war canoe in
the lead. So many wanted to go that each of the smaller canoes bore
three. Some of the little girls who could not paddle were among those
who sat more or less comfortably on life preservers in the middle. Or it
would be one of the older girls who took the middle position, to change
places with some tired paddler in bow or stern as need might be. The
girls were reminded of the rules that no one was to change places in
midstream. They must paddle to shore and make the adjustment. Lunch was
distributed among the canoes, for the launches could not go up the
shallow Androscoggin.</p>
<p>Hilary and Lilian took June with them. Frances, Betty and Cathalina were
together. Neither Betty nor Cathalina had as much endurance as Frances,
but they thought that by changing occasionally, all would be able to
make the eight or ten-mile paddle with ease. Eloise, Helen and Isabel
were together and rather evenly matched in paddling ability, as were
Marion, Jean and Nora. Patty, with another councillor, carried some of
the heavier packages or cans of lunch in their canoe.</p>
<p>“Hard luck, Miss West,” called Isabel; “what you have in the middle of
your canoe can’t change places and help you paddle.”</p>
<p>“Some of it will help me paddle coming back,” answered Patty, pointing
to the milk can and package of sandwiches. “And Mr. Clark has gone on
ahead to see about getting corn for us to roast.”</p>
<p>“O, joy!” exclaimed Isabel, “corn and bacon! I saw them putting in the
bacon.”</p>
<p>“Do we wait till we get to Brunswick before we have lunch?” asked
Eloise. “Patty spoke as if we would.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so,” said Isabel. “We build a fire somewhere along
the river, I think.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see the war canoe. I wonder which side of this big island we
take.”</p>
<p>“I believe the one to the left is the way,” and Isabel pointed out a few
imaginary indications that the war canoe had taken that course. But it
turned out that while their canoe had no trouble in getting through,
this channel would have been too shallow for the war canoe. It had gone
to the right. There were many sand bars in the river, but the paddling
was easy. There was no wind and the water was calm, like a mirror
reflecting the rocks and dark green trees of the shore, while the dark
blue canoes came stealing up on the grassy surface to add to the beauty
of the scene. Not even the most practical girl, her mind chiefly upon
getting to the destination, eating lunch and getting points for
paddling, could fail to be impressed by it.</p>
<p>“Shall we go to see Bowdoin College?” inquired Helen.</p>
<p>“In this rig?”</p>
<p>“Excuse the question, Eloise; I forgot our picnic garb. I remember the
girls said that they usually go by trolley from Bath.”</p>
<p>It must be admitted that a substantial lunch adds much to the joy of
such picnics. This one was especially good. The corn was boiled in a big
kettle, which was borrowed or hired for the occasion. Such perfect and
tender ears they were. Boiling was substituted for roasting and saved
much time, a second lot of ears going in the pot as soon as the first
came out. Potato salad and pickles, all the sandwiches one could eat,
cake, ripe pears and all the milk one could drink,—what more could they
ask? Yet still came marshmallows, passed around to be toasted over the
embers.</p>
<p>“We’ll start home early, girls,” announced the young director of
athletics. “Then we can take our time, change often if we get tired, and
everything will be in our favor, no wind, and tide and current in the
right direction. I believe we could almost float home!”</p>
<p>It was not quite like floating, however, and the girls earned their
points for paddling. But without trouble they all reached camp in good
season, and in good humor to think that they had carried through a
twenty-mile paddle.</p>
<p>“How much do you think I paddled, Frances?” asked Cathalina, as they put
away their paddles.</p>
<p>“O, you must have paddled half the way, in resting either Betty or me.”</p>
<p>“Scarcely that, I’m afraid. You paddled too long several times and
wouldn’t let me take it, you know. You were afraid I’d get too tired.”</p>
<p>“Not at all. Wanted the points.”</p>
<p>“Never mind, I know you. You would take stern most of the way, too.”</p>
<p>“I wish you were coming to Greycliff next year, Frances,” said Betty.
“How you would fit in with our crowd. You would love Polly and Juliet,
and how proud we’d be of you!”</p>
<p>“That is awfully dear of you, Betty. For ‘half a cent’ I’d come. But I
don’t think I can.”</p>
<p>“Think about it, anyhow,” Betty insisted.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XXIII</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>“STUNT NIGHT” WITH SQUIRRELS’ INN</span>
</h2>
</div>
<p>Several things had conspired to put off the White Mountain and Wiscasset
trips, till within about ten days of the close of camp. The first was a
three days’ jaunt, when the girls were taken first by boat, then by
truck, with their packs, to the foot of Mt. Washington, which they were
to climb. The second led to historic little Wiscasset, part of the way
by boat, the rest a hike, except for the little girls who were taken all
the way by launch. The night was spent under the stars near the old
block house, meals were carried in the launches, and the return the next
day was on the same plan, partly by boat, partly on foot.</p>
<p>Patty despaired of having any practice for the Squirrels’ Inn “stunt”,
but concluded that inasmuch as they were not attempting any formal
performance before a critical audience, one or two hasty rehearsals of
the program as a whole in the club room would do. Only Frances and
Hilary were going to Mt. Washington, but the other girls all went to
Wiscasset.</p>
<p>At last the fateful night arrived, stage property was quickly collected,
each girl having her own peculiar accoutrement to gather, and Miss
Patricia was on hand with the program in full, ready to prompt or to
take part with the performers. At the piano was a musical councillor,
who was to play the accompaniments, and Eloise, who had been ill when
her own klondike had their evening, had been asked to help with the
singing. That it was a musical program might be taken for granted by any
who knew Miss West’s tastes and her chief avocation. But it is not to be
supposed that she would undertake any classical performance as a
“stunt”. The music consisted of the popular airs; the songs were little
verses illustrating Merrymeeting activities, all bound together by one
central idea.</p>
<p>That announcement of the numbers might be avoided, the girls had
prepared small programs written on ordinary yellow tablet paper, cut and
folded. The audience upon the floor of the club room read upon the
outside:</p>
<div style='text-align:center; text-indent:0; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; '>
<div style='margin-top:1em;'>Squirrels’ Inn</div>
<div>Presents</div>
<div>The Merrymeeting Follies</div>
<div>of 19—</div>
<div style='margin-bottom:1em;'>Monday Evening, August ——</div>
</div>
<p>Inside they found the program in order, and tongues were busy as they
looked it through.</p>
<p>“O, I wonder what that is. Do you suppose that the doctor will really be
in it?”</p>
<p>“Took at this: ‘Bird Hike.... Bird, Mother Nature and Chorus’. Birdie,
are you going to take part?”</p>
<p>“Of course not,” replied the nature lady, settling back in her little
rocking chair. “But I lent them my rubber boots and hat.”</p>
<p>“I wonder,” said Betty behind the curtain, “if they will take it in
about the head band.”</p>
<p>“Of course they will,” said Frances, who was just adjusting hers across
her forehead. “The headband—the connecting link which has a symbol for
all the things we do!” This with the explanatory gesture of an orator.</p>
<p>“There will be some funny symbols put up tonight,” said Betty, tossing
up a volley ball.</p>
<p>“I guess so. Imagine a pickle jar on our head bands! Dear me, I hope I
don’t forget my songs.”</p>
<p>“You haven’t had much time to learn them. Have you gotten over the
effects of mountain climbing?”</p>
<p>“O, yes; there weren’t any, except my tired feet.”</p>
<p>“Everybody here and ready?” asked Miss Patricia, looking last to see if
Isabel and Virgie, who were to manage the curtains, were in place.</p>
<p>At her signal, they drew aside the curtains, revealing the eight
girls—Frances, Marion, Nora, Hilary, Lilian, Betty, Cathalina and
Eloise, who were dressed in full camp costume, including head bands, arm
bands, and diamonds on the sweaters, and carried each some emblem of
Merrymeeting activities, from volley ball and paddle to the silver cup
marked Merrymeeting Trophy.</p>
<p>After a chord from the accompanist, the girls sang to a popular ragtime
tune the “Opening Chorus” of the program:</p>
<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:1.4em; '>  “Just a head band,</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    Golden and Blue;</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:1.4em; '>  Athletic emblems</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    Of what we can do—</div>
<div class='cbline'>Swimming, baseball, tennis, paddling, basketball,</div>
<div class='cbline'>Volley, hiking,—at our camp we do them all.</div>
<div class='blankline'></div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:1.4em; '>  But these symbols</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    Don’t represent you;</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:1.4em; '>  There are other things</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    That you do,</div>
<div class='cbline'>And if you will watch our little show tonight,</div>
<div class='cbline'>We’ll give you a head band that’ll be right.”</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The curtains were drawn together in the midst of the applause which
welcomed the first appearance, but in a few moments were again parted
and drawn aside. The audience for a second expected an encore or a new
number, then saw the point as June shouted, “O, there’s the head band!”
For across the stage at a convenient height and pinned upon the wall was
an immense dark-blue “head band”, upon which had just been placed the
customary M C with a small pine tree on each side. The golden symbols,
like the program, were cut from yellow tablet paper.</p>
<p>“I get it,” said Jo. “They’re making a head band with our ‘Follies’.”</p>
<p>The first activity to be perpetuated in song was the “Marshmallow Roast”
of the program. When the curtains were drawn, they disclosed in the
foreground a camp fire made of sticks, in the center of which glowed a
lighted lantern covered with red paper. Close to this sat the
“marshmallow”, covered with white and occasionally shaking a white
powder from the drapery, by which she was concealed. Frances stood back
of her holding the stick on which she was supposed to be impaled. The
tune was “Old Black Joe”.</p>
<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:1.4em; '>  “Marshmallow plump,</div>
<div class='cbline'>With sugar powdered o’er;</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:1.4em; '>  Marshmallow white,</div>
<div class='cbline'>They wish they had some more;</div>
<div class='blankline'></div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:1.4em; '>  Marshmallow brown,</div>
<div class='cbline'>As down their throats I go,—</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:1.4em; '>  I hear Camp Merrymeeting calling</div>
<div class='cbline'>‘Marshmallow!’</div>
<div class='blankline'></div>
<div class='cbline' style='font-size:0.9em;'>CHORUS:</div>
<div class='blankline'></div>
<div class='cbline'>Marshmallow, marshmallow,</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:1.4em; '>  I’m used for every roast;</div>
<div class='cbline'>I hear Camp Merrymeeting calling,</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:1.4em; '>  ‘Toast! Toast! Toast!’”</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Curtain. Curtains apart again. A fat marshmallow on the head band, next
to one of the pine trees.</p>
<p>“This next ought to be funny,” said Dot, who was in the front row.
“‘Deep Sea Fishing, (a) Fish Chorus, (b) Fishermen’s Chorus.’ How can
they fix up fish?”</p>
<p>“They don’t have to much,” answered June. “We are supposed to use our
imagination. Hilary says that they didn’t use to have all the stage
fixings that they think they have to now.”</p>
<p>“Sh-sh, here they are!”</p>
<p>Four girls in Merrymeeting costume sat upon the edge of the big table
under the head band. With sticks and lines they were fishing. In front
of them, facing the audience, but lying upon the floor in swimming
position, were four “fish”, just the girls, in customary garb, without
any attempt at a fish costume. To the lively tune of Jingle Bells, and
with the movements appropriate to swimming and “flapping” of fins, they
sang the following ditty:</p>
<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline'>“We are the fishes gay,</div>
<div class='cbline'>Swimming every day,</div>
<div class='cbline'>In the ocean blue,</div>
<div class='cbline'>Just see what we can do!</div>
<div class='cbline'>We dart and dance about,</div>
<div class='cbline'>Each minnow and each trout;</div>
<div class='cbline'>We glisten and we gleam,</div>
<div class='cbline'>As we sidestroke down stream.</div>
<div class='blankline'></div>
<div class='cbline' style='font-size:0.9em;'>CHORUS:</div>
<div class='blankline'></div>
<div class='cbline'>Flap your fins! Flap your fins,</div>
<div class='cbline'>Fishies in the sea,</div>
<div class='cbline'>Oh what fun to splash and dive</div>
<div class='cbline'>And swim so gay and free!</div>
<div class='cbline'>Flap your fins! Flap your fins,</div>
<div class='cbline'>Fishies in the sea,</div>
<div class='cbline'>O, who would not a fishie be</div>
<div class='cbline'>In the bottom of the sea!”</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At this, the fishers started a rollicking chorus with waving lines:</p>
<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline'>“We’re deep-sea fishers,</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:1.4em; '>  Watch us fish!</div>
<div class='cbline'>We ride out over the ocean</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:1.4em; '>  Where-e’er we wish.</div>
<div class='blankline'></div>
<div class='cbline'>We don’t have to wait for the fish to bite,</div>
<div class='cbline'>They jump on the hooks when we heave in sight,—</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:5.6em; '>        We’re deep-sea fishers,</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:7.0em; '>          Watch us fish!”</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At the appropriate time the fishes turned and caught the lines, then
rose as the fishers jumped down from the table, and all danced around in
a circle, while the accompanist played the tune through once, finishing
it as the last fish or fisher disappeared through the door in the midst
of most enthusiastic applause, especially from those who had memories of
the deep-sea fishing trip.</p>
<p>The Bird Hike was introduced by a solo from the bird, the burden of
whose refrain was:</p>
<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline'>“Come along, there’s a bird hike here today;</div>
<div class='cbline'>Get you ready, there’s a bird hike here today;</div>
<div class='cbline'>I know them by their graceful walk,</div>
<div class='cbline'>There’s a bird hike here today.</div>
<div class='cbline'>I’m a poor old fowl, but I’ll fool ’em yet,” etc.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hilary was the “bird”, and sat on the corner of that most convenient
table, when—enter Mother Nature and Girls. “Clementine” was the tune in
which the following musical conversation occurred:</p>
<div style='margin-left:2em; margin-top:1em'>
<div>GIRLS—</div>

<div style='margin-left:2em; margin-bottom:0.7em'>Mother Nature, Mother Nature,<br />
Shall we see some birds today?</div>

<div>MOTHER NATURE (ELOISE)—</div>

<div style='margin-left:2em; margin-bottom:0.7em'>Very likely, very likely,<br />
If only quiet you will stay.</div>

<div>GIRLS—</div>

<div style='margin-left:2em; margin-bottom:0.7em'>Mother Nature, Mother Nature,<br />
Here’s a rock where we may sit.</div>

<div>MOTHER NATURE—</div>

<div style='margin-left:2em; margin-bottom:0.7em'>Yes, sit down and all be quiet,<br />
While we wait for birds to flit.</div>

<div>GIRLS—</div>

<div style='margin-left:2em; margin-bottom:0.7em'>Mother Nature, Mother Nature,<br />
What’s that bird upon the limb?</div>

<div>MOTHER NATURE—</div>

<div style='margin-left:2em; margin-bottom:0.7em'>Steady now, give me the glasses,<br />
While I take a look at him.</div>
</div>
<p>Eloise as Mother Nature, in the well known hat pulled down over her
face, the scarlet blouse of the nature lady and the rubber boots which
had given her the title of Puss in Boots, was hailed with wild applause
and shrieks of delight from the audience. The nature lady herself leaned
back in her chair to laugh at this clever representation. In a sweet
contralto, Eloise sang her comments on the bird while she gazed through
the glasses:</p>
<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline'>“Dear little bird in the bushes,</div>
<div class='cbline'>Under the old pine tree,</div>
<div class='cbline'>Singing alone,</div>
<div class='cbline'>In a sweetly cheerful tone,</div>
<div class='cbline'>Perching in the air(!)</div>
<div class='cbline'>Flying everywhere!</div>
<div class='cbline'>Notice the marks on his wings, girls;</div>
<div class='cbline'>Look at the stripe on his knee;</div>
<div class='cbline'>I’m sure this pretty bird</div>
<div class='cbline'>Will be the rarest thing we’ve heard</div>
<div class='cbline'>What kind of a bird, girls,</div>
<div class='cbline'>Can that bird be?”</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The girls now took up the air, repeating the same song with Eloise, and
assuming attitudes of delight when the Bird began to sing. But how their
expressions changed as he announced that as only a Plymouth Rock rooster
“cock-a-doodle-doo” was all that he could sing, “when I flap my wing,
scaring everything”. And while he would like to be an “eagle” or a
“flycatcher”, it was merely as a “scratcher” that he could claim their
interest. Curtain.</p>
<p>The “Merrymeeting Moon”, which came next, was entirely different from
anything which had been given. Lilian, who represented the chief editor,
Maribelle Hartley, was prettily dressed in a real party frock, filmy and
beautiful, wore silver slippers and carried a round “moon.” This was a
round circle of cardboard, cut out in the center to leave only a wide
rim and covered with silvered paper. Grace and gestures with this moon
and a few steps here and there to show the silver slippers accompanied a
very pretty song written to one of the more elaborate ragtime tunes.</p>
<p>“Merrymeeting needs your gleaming, just to keep us all a-beaming,” sang
Lilian, addressing the silver moon which she was holding above her head;
and at the close of the song she stood with her face framed within the
rim while singing:</p>
<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    “Can’t you all tell</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    That I’m Maribelle,</div>
<div class='cbline'>I’m the Man in the Moon, you see.”</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The audience was scarcely satisfied with one repetition of this, but
time was pressing and the program had to go on. By this time a fish, a
bird and a moon had been added to the symbols on the head band.</p>
<p>The girls enjoyed taking off the camp doctor in the next act, called on
the program, The Infirmary, Doctor—and Gargling Girls. There had been
some mild cases of tonsilitis, immediately isolated in the “Infirmary”,
where, with skull and cross-bones, the girls had announced the “Leper
Colony” on a clever sign, and bewailed their isolation. This was all
portrayed in the sketch. First the girls appeared, wrapped in long bath
robes and singing pathetically about the “tonsils’ retreat” and the
“little cots, whose owners have spots,—</p>
<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline'>And the doctor’s job,</div>
<div class='cbline'>Their throats to swab,</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:1.4em; '>  Can’t be beat!”</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Their temperature was “torrid” and the gargle “horrid”. Then came the
doctor, who looked at their throats with the aid of an immense kitchen
spoon, and sang with great enjoyment a solo to the effect that he had
waited long to catch them, but had them fast quarantined now. Giving
each a spoonful from a large bottle, he stood before them like an
orchestra leader, and beat time with the spoon, while in throaty tones
to the tune of John Brown’s Body the girls sang, “Gargle, gargle,
gargle, gargle,” etc., and falling into a procession behind the doctor,
filed out. This proved so popular that the “doctor” was forced to repeat
his solo and lead again the chorus of gargling girls. Frances, of
course, as the tallest of the girls, impersonated the doctor and tried
to imitate his step and movements. This time the curtains parted to show
a spoon on the head band.</p>
<p>“What do you suppose the next will be?” asked Jean in the audience.</p>
<p>“It says ‘Pickles’,” replied Rhoda, “but who knows how they’ll do it?”</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>When Isabel and Virgie drew the curtains, Betty, Cathalina and Nora
stood there decked in green crepe paper, Betty’s costume having yellow
trimmings. At once Betty, to the tune of “Reuben, Reuben” began the song
of the pickled onion:</p>
<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline'>“Picnic pickles you’ve been eating,</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    All the pickles you could get,</div>
<div class='cbline'>I should think you’d hate to think of</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    All the pickles you have ‘et’,—</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:5.6em; '>        H’m-te-dum-tum,</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:5.6em; '>        H’m-tum-dum!”</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:5.6em; '>        (Turning around quickly)</div>
<div class='blankline'></div>
<div class='cbline'>“Here behold the pickled onion</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    Round and sweet as I can be,</div>
<div class='cbline'>Where’ll you find another onion</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    Anywhere to equal me?</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:5.6em; '>        H’m-te-dum-tum,” etc.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nora now took up the song:</p>
<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline'>“My name’s pickled cauliflower,</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    I’m as crisp as I can be;</div>
<div class='cbline'>Where’ll you find another cauliflower</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    Anywhere to equal me?” Refr.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Cathalina’s inquiry was similar:</p>
<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline'>“Once I was a full-sized pickle,</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    But they came and quartered me;</div>
<div class='cbline'>Where’ll you find a quartered pickle</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    Anywhere to equal me?” Refr.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>At this point the Picnic Pickles joined hands above their heads and
circled the stage singing:</p>
<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline'>“Three sweet pickles in the barrel,</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    Picnic pickles can’t be beat;</div>
<div class='cbline'>Merrymeeting girls all love us,</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    Eat and smile and smile and eat!”</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>“Merrymeeting Music” not unkindly took off several of the girls in camp,
among them one of the chief “yell-leaders”, and Rhoda, whose really
beautiful piano playing the girls had so much enjoyed all through the
weeks of camp. Marion represented her and sang; to “Boola, Boola”:</p>
<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline'>“I am Rhoda</div>
<div class='cbline'>I can play</div>
<div class='cbline'>Brahms and Chopin</div>
<div class='cbline'>Any day.</div>
<div class='blankline'></div>
<div class='cbline'>If you listen</div>
<div class='cbline'>I’ll start you off</div>
<div class='cbline'>On the Prelude</div>
<div class='cbline'>Of Rachmaninoff.”</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Lilian, with her guitar, and Eloise with ukulele, sat upon the floor to
sing two or three of the camp favorites and represented the “Jazz” of
the program.</p>
<p>Musical notes now appeared upon the head band next to the pickle jar,
and the audience again consulted their programs. “Whiskaway” was to
appear.</p>
<p>Betty was slim and had made a remarkable though simple costume of black,
covering her arms with long black stockings and padding out with cotton
a muslin mask to imitate the muzzle of a dog. The rest of the face had a
comical expression, and the corners of the big square of muslin had been
tied into ears. A gentle old dog sometimes wandered into camp from a
neighboring farm, although dogs were forbidden, and had been dubbed
“Whiskaway” by the girls.</p>
<p>Down on her knees Betty moved about, causing much amusement among the
little girls in front by the waving of her paws and the swinging of the
doggy nose, which was not very well fastened at the lower part. At the
last Betty assumed a begging attitude, her stocking-covered hands
hanging limply over, with such effect that this tableau and chorus had
to be repeated:</p>
<div style='text-align:center; margin-top:0.5em; margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto'>
<div style='display:inline-block; text-align:left;'>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    “When a cold nose gives you a fright,</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:4.199999999999999em; '>      That’s dear Whiskaway;</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    When a footstep sounds in the night</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:4.199999999999999em; '>      That’s poor Whiskaway!</div>
<div class='cbline'>I love to sleep in the softest bed,—</div>
<div class='cbline'>I don’t care whether it’s the foot or the head.</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    I don’t mean to scare you,</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:4.199999999999999em; '>      But only prepare you</div>
<div class='cbline' style='padding-left:2.8em; '>    For poor, dear Whiskaway!”</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The ensemble chorus gave the new Merrymeeting song which had won the
prize. In this and the camp yell with which the performance closed the
audience could not help joining, and went away to sing these
masterpieces of poesy and song for the rest of the week.</p>

</h2>
</div>
<p>“Isn’t this the most exciting week?” queried Isabel.</p>
<p>“It is indeed,” replied Cathalina, who was feeling disappointed over
tennis results in the August tournament, provoked at herself for one or
two bad plays she had made, yet glad for Lilian that she had won the
tournament again. The girls had just finished the final baseball game
and both teams, with a few spectators, had strolled off to rest under
the trees. A cool breeze blew from the water which sparkled and foamed
over the rocks.</p>
<p>“Tournaments to be finished, the last points you can possibly get in
anything to be made, swimming match tomorrow, boys’ minstrel show next
day, then the last hike, the big banquet and prizes and everything on
Friday, and on Saturday the last senior lodge play! This hectic life of
pleasure has spoiled me for school!”</p>
<p>“Nonsense, Isabel. We’ll feel all the more like it,” said Lilian.</p>
<p>“There <i>are</i> those who love to study, I’m told,” said Isabel, who was
feeling anything but intellectual that morning, “but the only reason
that <i>I</i> do it is that I’m ashamed to be ignorant!”</p>
<p>“You are certainly frank about it,” Eloise remarked with a quizzical
smile.</p>
<p>“Then if you don’t study,” continued Isabel, saucily addressing Eloise,
“you can’t enjoy the real fun, because of what hangs over your head in
the way of cuts, lessons to be made up, letters home from the faculty,
and term work to be repeated because of failures.”</p>
<p>“To hear you talk, anybody would think that you are one of those who are
always on the ragged edge,” reproved Betty. “Frances, Isabel is one of
the best in her classes at Greycliff.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Betty, for your kind tribute, but I have learned by
observation,” said Isabel loftily, “and profited by seeing the awful
times the idlers have. They have to pay the bill some time, and that’s
the only reason I work.”</p>
<p>“Isabel is just thinking with her tongue about her reasons for work,”
said Virginia.</p>
<p>“Lots of people do that,” acknowledged Isabel, laughing.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately true,”—and Eloise gave Isabel a gentle push till she fell
over on the grass by Cathalina, who was lying at full length.</p>
<p>“Don’t you wish you knew,” continued Eloise, “what they’re going to do
at the banquet—and how the dining-room will be decorated,—and what the
eats will be,—and how the councillors will dress up,—and who will get
the prizes?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t miss the banquet for worlds!” cried Betty. “The girls all
say that it is always <i>wonderful</i>, and so exciting and thrilling about
the prizes. Why, sometimes the girls have the tears just streaming down
their cheeks, but root nobly for the one who took the prize away from
them!”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that I could do that,” said Virginia.</p>
<p>“O, you’d be ashamed not to be glad for the other girl, wouldn’t you?”</p>
<p>“It would just depend on who she was and how she took it,” said Virgie
with decision. “If she were airy and smarty, I wouldn’t like it.”</p>
<p>“N-no, but anybody’d be ashamed to be that way up here, or at least to
show it. There is too much camp spirit among us.”</p>
<p>Cathalina slipped her hand into Lilian’s and they exchanged an
affectionate look, which Hilary did not miss, and she patted Cathalina’s
shoulder approvingly.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for the girls that are leaving early,” Virgie continued. “Two
or three are going tomorrow. It’s a good thing that the games are about
over,—we’d have so few on our team.”</p>
<p>“What do we do next week, Frances?” asked Helen.</p>
<p>“Chiefly get ready to leave. It will take us all day Monday to pack.”</p>
<p>“How could it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t mean every minute, but there will be things to fix and hunt up.
We can have some good times in between at the club house, and play
tennis or anything we want to, you know, but we leave Tuesday afternoon,
and by Wednesday hardly anybody will be at camp.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t it make you sick to think about it? Maybe I’ll never be able to
come back here!” Helen’s eyes looked misty.</p>
<p>“We mustn’t think about it,” said Isabel. “Cheer up. Suppose you could
never go home and see your folks.”</p>
<p>“Listen to the practical Isabel,” laughed Lilian. “That’s right, Isabel;
always look forward to the next nice thing that you’re going to do!”</p>
<p>“By the way, girls,” said Isabel, “the last <i>Moon</i> will be read Sunday,
and I promised to see everybody and ask for a contribution. Every one of
you can hand in a personal or some little paragraph about something that
has happened in your klondike. I’m coming around Saturday and if you
haven’t written anything I’m going to sit down and wait till you do. No
promises go!”</p>
<p>“Might as well do it, girls,” said Eloise. “When the energetic Isabel
has a duty to perform, it is a case of ‘do it <i>now</i>’. O, dear, what fun
we have had!”</p>
<p>“<i>Are</i> having, <i>going</i> to have,” insisted Isabel. “Don’t start any
mourning, anybody. We’ll probably have enough of waterworks at the end,
and I, for one, don’t want to begin now.”</p>
<p>“You funny, nice, dear old Isabel,” said Cathalina, reaching a hand over
to rumple Isabel’s curly head.</p>
<p>Rapidly passed these last day of camp. The last games of the August
tournament were played. Reports of attainment and points earned were
handed in by the director of athletics, the swimming instructor and
other councillors. Excitement more or less suppressed spread among the
girls as they consulted with each other about whom to choose and vote
for in regard to the prize cups. From so many bright, helpful and
popular girls, who should be chosen as the best camper among the
seniors, the intermediates and the juniors? The girls were warned
against “campaigning” for their favorites. In this, points did not
count, except as indicating an interest in the activities. The best
“all-around camper” would not necessarily be the one who was first in
any particular activity. Former years in camp, giving what we might call
“cumulative” helpfulness and loyalty, counted also.</p>
<p>The annual “minstrels” at the boys’ camp was one of the great events.
Gay boat-loads of girls on that happy night went down to Boothbay Camp,
gave enthusiastic support and applause to the entertainment furnished by
the boys, enjoyed every feature, and joined heartily in the singing of
popular or camp songs while the curtains were drawn between “acts.” By
lantern and flashlight they again filled the boats for the unusual
experience of a ride home on the river after dark. A big flashlight
served occasionally as search light, but the pilot knew his river even
without a moon.</p>
<p>Mysterious indeed were the doings of councillors on the fateful Friday.
All girls were forbidden the dining-room after breakfast, except a few
who were asked to help bring down the “greenery” from the woods. These
had a peep at the unfinished decorations. There was to be a picnic lunch
at noon, to leave the dining-room free for the elaborate decorating, and
it was even a mystery where the lunch was to be. In the arts and crafts
room councillors were working on the last menu cards, which were being
painted and lettered, and occasionally a few girls would invent some
“necessary” errands, which would take them through the room into
Laugh-a-lot. But furtive glances only increased interest.</p>
<p>“I saw the cap the camp mother was making,” said one. “My, it was
pretty. There was a little crinkled yellow ruffle on the edge of black
crepe paper.”</p>
<p>“Then that’s the color scheme! I suppose they’ll wear caps and
aprons,—they did last year.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but it’s <i>never</i> the same, so you can’t tell.”</p>
<p>When the bell rang for lunch, all who had to go to the club house for
information were directed to the pine grove. But before this, many of
the girls had noticed the people who were trailing in that direction
with utensils and eatables. The big kettle of hot beans and some other
supplies were taken in the convenient and familiar wheelbarrow.</p>
<p>On the rocks at the right of the cove the fire was made and long, fat
“wienies” were being cooked in a big pan, which was supported on the
edge of the fire by two large chunks of wood.</p>
<p>“O, the beautiful, <i>beautiful</i> pine-grove!” exclaimed Cathalina, as she
took her place behind Hilary in the line, which had been halted by the
smiling head councillor some little distance from the fire till the
signal should be given that all was ready.</p>
<p>“If I come back next summer, I’m going to bring my paints and
everything,” she continued. “I’ve made some sketches, but I want to get
the blue of the blueberries with the dew on them, and some of the
sunsets are so gorgeous,—or so delicate. I saw the most peculiar effect
one night when we were starting a camp fire on Marshmallow Point for a
marshmallow roast. There were heavy brown-gray clouds and just one
streak where the sun was trying to shine through, and the queerest color
to the water. I thought of the old poem where ‘the dark Plutonian
shadows gather on the evening blast.’”</p>
<p>“Look at this little vine with the scarlet berries,” said Hilary,
stooping to gather a bit that was trailing along the ground. “Has this
been taken in to Mother Nature yet?”</p>
<p>“I think so, and there is another kind on the ground not far from where
the fire is. Yesterday I found the oddest little flower growing right
out of the rock in the cove. The flower was almost exactly like the
common little fall aster, purple of a sort, but the plant was a single
stalk and looked like an evergreen, made you think of balsam. I’m going
to ask Mother Nature what it is. I picked it.”</p>
<p>“Hurrah, here we go!” said Hilary, weaving the bit of vine in one of her
braids as the line started.</p>
<p>A pasteboard plate received the necessary silver, hot beans spooned out
of the kettle by one councillor, two or three “wieners” forked out by
the presiding masculine genius of the fire, the bread and butter for the
sandwiches, mustard if one wanted it, the good “picnic pickles” and a
sanitary cup for either water or milk. Dessert was to come later,
delicious watermelons, not brought down the hill, but served nearer the
entrance to the pine grove.</p>
<p>Evening came at last. Camp garb was laid aside for the pretty summer
dresses appropriate to the occasion. The girls thought that the bell
would never ring. The finishing touches seemed to take the councillors
forever! But at last the big bell clanged out its invitation, and the
girls came hurrying down the hill.</p>
<p>The dining-room looked almost like a bit of the pine grove, for the
rafters were covered by the green branches of the whole trees that had
been brought to deck the place, and stood around the supporting pillars
and at the sides of the room. White pine, balsam and arborvitæ filled
the dining hall with spicy odor. And if any were shocked at the cutting
of these big “Christmas trees”, they might have been told that they were
carefully selected where thinning was necessary and where the trees
would never have reached a perfect maturity when all had grown larger.</p>
<p>“O, isn’t it a dream!” exclaimed Lilian, as she found the place card
with her name on it at the same table with Cathalina, Hilary, Betty and
Eloise. “Look at these darling menu cards!”</p>
<p>“And read it,” said Hilary. “They’re too funny. Let’s see if we can make
out what the different things really are.”</p>
<p>“What do you suppose ‘Brunswick Special’ is?” wondered Cathalina.</p>
<p>“Maybe our pickles,” said Eloise. “No, it isn’t in the right place,—O, I
know, corn!”</p>
<p>“And the ‘Young Fried Flappers’ are the fried chickens, of course, and
Charlotte Young’s name.”</p>
<p>“Here’s ‘Piggly Wiggly’, now what can that be?”</p>
<p>“Look at the place on the menu; O, that’s the jelly, to be sure.”</p>
<p>“‘Truant’s Delight’ must be the ice-cream, and Virginia sauce must be
something we have over it and called in honor of Virgie!”</p>
<p>Just before the courses were served, the councillors in a long line,
with their giddy postage stamp caps and ruffled aprons, sang a brief
song beginning, “O, we are the councillors gay, tra-la,” and were
greeted with the hearty applause of appreciation and given, both
collectively and individually, the “rah-rahs” of Merrymeeting. But ah,
those plates of fried chicken, mashed potato and hot rolls! And the
platters of steaming corn, served because of its popularity. From
bouillon to salted almonds and candy, the refreshments seemed to be a
success and the councillors saw to it that each girl had all she wanted.
The hour was early, even if dinner was a trifle late.</p>
<p>More than one heart beat a little faster when the table which held the
three cups and little packages marked with different names was moved to
the center. Chairs were moved back and turned to face in the right
direction. The head councillors, in a brief speech full of charm and
sincerity, spoke of the camp ideals and of what these prizes would
represent, then began to call the names and present to each the prize
which she had worked for and won. Not all could win distinction. Some
girlish hopes were bound to be disappointed, either when expectation was
greater than the facts warranted, or when the contest was so close that
no one could tell how the vote would turn.</p>
<p>Hilary won the ring; Lilian, Cathalina, Eloise and Isabel, pins.
Hilary’s record was unblemished by any tardiness or absence. She had
identified birds and flowers, taken the hikes, climbed Mt. Washington,
and had been so generally helpful and well liked that some of the girls
had voted for her to have the senior cup. Lilian had won the tennis
tournament, and Cathalina had won second place, having vanquished all
her opponents but Lilian. Isabel, in addition to a long list of
activities, had won the swimming meet. Eloise, like Lilian, had been
especially good with the musical affairs, and had made points in all
lines. Both musical notes and a paddle for canoeing were on her
headband, with the usual symbols. Betty had not quite enough points for
a pin, but received arm band and diamond.</p>
<p>The suspense was great when it came to awarding the honor cups to the
girls who had been considered and voted the best campers. Frances of the
seniors, Charlotte Young of the intermediates, a sweet girl, whose
election was practically unanimous, and little June Lancaster of the
juniors, were announced. June was quite overcome and went forward for
her trophy in great trepidation, while Hilary beamed with pride in her
little sister. The girls in excited groups gathered to see the prizes of
those who had won them, and then gradually left the dining hall, looking
back to see the prettily decorated tables and the tired, but happy
councillors who were about to consume the rest of the chicken!</p>
<p>The great event was over. Packing and leave-taking were close at hand. A
few days more saw the girls on the eve of their final departure. Many
times had they floated away from the little dock, but always to return.</p>
<p>The house party planned by Cathalina was really to be carried out. The
girls’ trunks were to go by train to New York, but Mrs. Van Buskirk and
Philip were to meet them with the big car in Bath, whence by easy stages
they would travel to the Van Buskirk home. Cathalina, Lilian, Hilary,
Betty, Campbell and Philip were the young people of the party. Philip
and Campbell would drive the car by turns.</p>
<p>At last all were ready. The boats were waiting. A bright sun had shone
out, after a dark morning, to render the last pictures of Merrymeeting
things of beauty and a joy forever. As the boats moved off, there was
waving of many hands to the few campers left standing upon the dock.</p>
<p>An unexpected hush fell upon the girls in the Aeolus, and to Isabel’s
great surprise she felt a lump in her throat and several tears trickling
down her cheeks. Two or three of the girls were openly crying.</p>
<p>“Mercy, girls,” said Isabel, “this will never do! Come on and sing!
Lilian and Eloise, start something!”</p>
<p>“Camping Days,” suggested Eloise, and in a moment, to the old tune of
“College Days”, the cheerful voices of contented campers, looking
forward to their trip and home, mingled with the chugging of the engine
and the splashing of waters.</p>
